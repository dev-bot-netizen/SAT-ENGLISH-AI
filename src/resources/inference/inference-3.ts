**Passage:**
Marta Coll and colleagues' 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri's 2000 census-a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers' decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri's census.
B. some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.
C. Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.
D. the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text's discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues' count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri's count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms' morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms' structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers' decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did.
* **Incorrect (A):** Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues' count and Bianchi and Morri's count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri's study.
* **Incorrect (C):** Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species.
* **Incorrect (D):** Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference-it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Researchers recently found that disruptions to an enjoyable experience, like a short series of advertisements during a television show, often increase viewers' reported enjoyment. Suspecting that disruptions to an unpleasant experience would have the opposite effect, the researchers had participants listen to construction noise for 30 minutes and anticipated that those whose listening experience was frequently interrupted with short breaks of silence would thus ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. find the disruptions more irritating as time went on.
B. rate the listening experience as more negative than those whose listening experience was uninterrupted.
C. rate the experience of listening to construction noise as lasting for less time than it actually lasted.
D. perceive the volume of the construction noise as growing softer over time.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** Choice B is the best answer. It most logically completes the text. The text tells us that disruptions to an enjoyable experience increase viewers' enjoyment. It also says that researchers suspect the opposite is true for disruptions to an unpleasant experience. Thus, we can infer that the researchers expect to find that the interrupted unpleasant experience was worse for listeners than the uninterrupted unpleasant experience.
* **Incorrect (A):** Choice A is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text. The text never makes any claims about how irritating the disruptions themselves are perceived to be. Rather, the text says that pleasant experiences are perceived as more enjoyable with interruptions, and that the opposite is suspected to be true of unpleasant experiences.
* **Incorrect (C):** Choice C is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text. The text never makes any claims about how long any experience is perceived to be. Rather, the text says that pleasant experiences are perceived as more enjoyable with interruptions, and that the opposite is suspected to be true of unpleasant experiences.
* **Incorrect (D):** Choice D is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text. The text never makes any claims about how interruptions affect the perceived volume of the unpleasant or pleasant experience. Rather, the text says that pleasant experiences are perceived as more enjoyable with interruptions, and that the opposite is suspected to be true of unpleasant experiences.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
German theater practitioner Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) believed that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, provoking them to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted onstage. Brecht's influence can be seen in English playwright Caryl Churchill's 1979 play Cloud 9: although the play sometimes invites empathetic reactions, it primarily works to engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism, which it does by placing audiences at a distance, thereby encouraging them to ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. focus on the characters' beliefs about social and political issues as revealed by the characters' actions.
B. reflect on social and political phenomena not directly related to patriarchy and colonialism.
C. recognize pertinent social and political parallels between Germany during Brecht's time and England at the time when Churchill was writing Cloud 9.
D. be dispassionate as they think critically about the social and political questions raised by the play.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** Choice D is the best answer. Churchill's play was influenced by Brecht's belief that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, making them think about social and political issues that also exist outside of the play. Therefore, it makes sense that Churchill would strive to have audiences think dispassionately (i.e., without emotion) and critically about the social and political questions raised by the play.
* **Incorrect (A):** The passage mentions that Churchill was influenced by Brecht's belief that plays should provoke audience members "to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted onstage," so there's no basis for an inference about audience members deeply engaging with characters' beliefs and actions.
* **Incorrect (B):** Reflecting on things that aren't related to patriarchy and colonialism wouldn't "engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism." That creates a confusing contradiction.
* **Incorrect (C):** No mention is made of social and political issues in Germany during Brecht's time, so there's no basis for this inference.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Archaeologists and historians used to believe that the Maya civilization during its Classic period (roughly 250-900) lacked agricultural marketplaces. One reason for this belief was that these scholars misunderstood the ecology of the regions the Maya inhabited. Marketplaces typically emerge because different individuals or groups want to trade resources they control for resources they don't control. Scholars seriously underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya landscape and thus assumed that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. marketplaces likely would not have attracted many traders from outside the regions controlled by the Maya.
B. farming practices would have been largely the same throughout Maya lands even if the crops people produced varied significantly.
C. marketplaces would not have enabled Maya people to acquire many products different from those they already produced.
D. farmers would trade agricultural products only if they had already produced enough to meet their own needs.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of scholars' understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn't have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don't otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn't produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn't have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn't have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops.
* **Incorrect (A):** Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars' mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren't very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn't have marketplaces, it wouldn't lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people.
* **Incorrect (B):** Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops people produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not provide information to support this choice.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Many animals, including humans, must sleep, and sleep is known to have a role in everything from healing injuries to encoding information in long-term memory. But some scientists claim that, from an evolutionary standpoint, deep sleep for hours at a time leaves an animal so vulnerable that the known benefits of sleeping seem insufficient to explain why it became so widespread in the animal kingdom. These scientists therefore imply that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. prolonged deep sleep is likely advantageous in ways that have yet to be discovered.
B. most traits perform functions that are hard to understand from an evolutionary standpoint.
C. it is more important to understand how widespread prolonged deep sleep is than to understand its function.
D. many traits that provide significant benefits for an animal also likely pose risks to that animal.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** Choice A is the best answer. It most logically completes the text. The text says that some scientists can’t explain why prolonged deep sleep is so widespread, given that the known benefits of sleep don’t seem to make up for how vulnerable it leaves an animal. This suggests that prolonged deep sleep probably has unknown evolutionary benefits.
* **Incorrect (B):** The passage doesn't mention other traits, so this inference is not supported.
* **Incorrect (C):** The passage does not compare the importance of understanding the function and the widespread nature of deep sleep.
* **Incorrect (D):** While the passage mentions the risk of vulnerability and benefits of sleep, it doesn't make a general claim about many traits.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Geoglyphs are large-scale designs of lines or shapes created in a natural landscape. The Nazca Lines were created in the Nazca Desert in Peru by several Indigenous civilizations over a period of many centuries. Peruvian archaeologist Johny Isla specializes in these geoglyphs. At a German exhibit about the Nazca Lines, he saw an old photograph of a large geoglyph of a whalelike figure and was surprised that he didn't recognize it. Isla returned to Peru and used a drone to search a wide area, looking for the figure from the air. This approach suggests that Isla thought that if he hadn't already seen it, the whalelike geoglyph ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. must represent a species of whale that went extinct before there were any people in Peru.
B. is actually located in Germany, not Peru, and isn't part of the Nazca Lines at all.
C. is probably in a location Isla hadn't ever come across while on the ground.
D. was almost certainly created a long time after the other Nazca Lines geoglyphs were created.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Johny Isla and the whalelike geoglyph. The text indicates that the German exhibit about the Nazca Lines included a photograph showing a whalelike geoglyph that Isla hadn't known about before attending the exhibit, even though Isla "specializes in" Nazca Lines geoglyphs. Given his expertise, and his surprise at being unfamiliar with the whale glyph, the text strongly suggests that Isla believed he would have noticed the glyph if he had been to its location. Thus, the text implies that the whalelike geoglyph is likely in a location Isla had not previously been to.
* **Incorrect (A):** This inference is not supported by the text.
* **Incorrect (B):** This inference is incorrect. The exhibit was about the Nazca Lines, which are in Peru.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not provide information to support this inference.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Indigenous cultures possess unique knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants. According to a 2021 study, 73 percent of the medicinal uses of plants native to North America are reflected in the vocabulary of a single Indigenous language. However, as more and more Indigenous people exclusively speak a globally dominant language, such as English, their ancestral languages fade from daily use. These facts lend added importance to tribal nations' efforts to preserve their languages. By ensuring the continued use of Cherokee, Ojibwe, and the hundreds of other Indigenous languages in what is now the United States, tribal nations are also ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. increasing the number of medicinal plants represented in the vocabularies of Indigenous languages.
B. transmitting terms for medicinal plants from Indigenous languages to globally dominant languages.
C. preserving knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations' lands.
D. ensuring that citizens of tribal nations have physical access to medicinal plants.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the relationship between Indigenous languages and knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants. The text states that Indigenous cultures possess special knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants, which is reflected in their vocabulary. The text then discusses how tribal nations are working to preserve their languages, whose daily use is declining as globally dominant languages become increasingly dominant in Indigenous communities. Given that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as repositories of knowledge about plants' medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations' lands.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text states that preserving Indigenous languages will increase the knowledge, not the number, of medicinal plants.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text is concerned with how vocabulary can be preserved through the continued daily use of Indigenous languages, not with how such vocabulary can be incorporated into other languages.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text doesn't discuss physical access to medicinal plants, instead focusing on Indigenous knowledge and language.
