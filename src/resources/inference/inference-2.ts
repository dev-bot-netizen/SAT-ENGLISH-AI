**Passage:**
In her 2021 article "Throwaway History: Towards a Historiography of Ephemera," scholar Anne Garner discusses John Johnson (1882-1956), a devoted collector of items intended to be discarded, including bus tickets and campaign pamphlets. Johnson recognized that scholarly institutions considered his expansive collection of ephemera to be worthless-indeed, it wasn't until 1968, after Johnson's death, that Oxford University's Bodleian Library acquired the collection, having grasped the items' potential value to historians and other researchers. Hence, the example of Johnson serves to ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. demonstrate the difficulties faced by contemporary historians in conducting research at the Bodleian Library without access to ephemera.
B. represent the challenge of incorporating examples of ephemera into the collections of libraries and other scholarly institutions.
C. lend support to arguments by historians and other researchers who continue to assert that ephemera holds no value for scholars.
D. illustrate both the relatively low scholarly regard in which ephemera was once held and the later recognition of ephemera's possible utility.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** Choice D is the best answer. Johnson collected "ephemera," or things that are meant to be thrown away. Scholars thought his collection was worthless to them, then later realized that it was potentially valuable. This suggests that scholars went from disregarding ephemera to recognizing their usefulness.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text tells us that the Bodleian Library acquired Johnson's large collection of ephemera back in 1968, so we can assume that contemporary historians conducting research there do have access to that collection.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text tells us that "Oxford University's Bodleian Library acquired the collection," but it never suggests that it was a challenge to do so.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text actually suggests the opposite: the example of Johnson's collection lends support to arguments that ephemera does hold value for scholars.

### Question 2 of 4 ###
**Passage:**
Some businesses believe that when employees are interrupted while doing their work, they experience a decrease in energy and productivity. However, a team led by Harshad Puranik, who studies management, has found that interruptions by colleagues can have a social component that increases employees' sense of belonging, resulting in greater job satisfaction that benefits employees and employers. Therefore, businesses should recognize that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. the interpersonal benefits of some interruptions in the workplace may offset the perceived negative effects.
B. in order to maximize productivity, employers should be willing to interrupt employees frequently throughout the day.
C. most employees avoid interrupting colleagues because they don't appreciate being interrupted themselves.
D. in order to cultivate an ideal workplace environment, interruptions of work should be discouraged.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of potential benefits of interruptions in the workplace. The text indicates that a common belief in business is that interruptions to working employees decrease energy and productivity levels. However, the text goes on to explain that a research team led by Harshad Puranik has found that there could be a social benefit to these interruptions. Since the team found that workplace interruptions can increase employees' sense of belonging and job satisfaction, it follows that the interpersonal benefits of some interruptions can offset the perceived negative effects.
* **Incorrect (B):** Although the text presents research findings that suggest some workplace interruptions can have a positive effect on employee job satisfaction, no further information is presented to suggest at what frequency these interruptions are ideal. Furthermore, the text doesn't tie workplace interruptions to increased productivity, but rather links it to social benefits such as sense of belonging.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text doesn't address employees' motives for choosing not to interrupt their colleagues. The text presents research findings that suggest that there are some positive interpersonal effects of workplace interruptions that can increase employee job satisfaction.
* **Incorrect (D):** Asking businesses to discourage workplace interruptions doesn't follow from the team's research about the benefits of workplace interruptions, nor does the text describe an ideal work environment. Instead, the text presents research suggesting that there may be positive aspects to workplace interruptions that haven't previously been considered.

### Question 3 of 4 ###
**Passage:**
Songbirds learn to respond to and imitate their species' songs from an early age. With each generation, small differences are introduced that result in distinct variations-called dialects-among geographically isolated populations of the same species. A research study examined whether twelve-day-old Ficedula hypoleuca (pied flycatcher) nestlings prefer local dialects over the unfamiliar dialects of nonlocal F. hypoleuca populations: the more begging calls the nestlings made in response to a song, the stronger their preference. The researchers found that nestlings produced more begging calls in response to their own dialect than to nonlocal dialects. Since song preference plays a role in songbird mate selection, the finding suggests that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. F. hypoleuca nestlings' preference for their own dialect likely disappears as they mature to promote socialization between different F. hypoleuca populations.
B. F. hypoleuca nestlings who show an early preference for their own dialect are likely to receive more food from their caretakers than nestlings who show no preferences among any F. hypoleuca dialects.
C. F. hypoleuca nestlings' preference for their own dialect likely drives them when they mature to reproduce with other F. hypoleuca from local rather than nonlocal populations.
D. F. hypoleuca nestlings show a preference for both local F. hypoleuca dialects and the songs of other local songbirds over the songs of nonlocal birds of any species.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** Choice C is the best answer. Because "song preference plays a role in songbird mate selection," and because F hypoleuca nestlings display a preference for local dialects, we can infer that they will be more likely to choose mates from local populations.
* **Incorrect (A):** We don't have any information suggesting that this preference disappears, so there's no basis for this inference.
* **Incorrect (B):** Although the passage discusses the number of begging calls made in response to various F. hypoleuca dialects, no mention is made about the amount of food received based on dialect preference. Therefore, there's no basis for this inference.
* **Incorrect (D):** There's no mention in the passage of methods of other types of local songbirds, so there's no basis for this inference.

### Question 4 of 4 ###
**Passage:**
Dutch painters in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries often showed tables filled with large wheels of cheese or carved shards of butter. Some art historians, noting that dairy products were a major component of the Dutch diet, interpret these depictions as reflections of everyday Dutch eating habits. However, a group of researchers recently reviewed hundreds of food-related paintings and found that lemons-which could only be acquired in the Netherlands at great cost, since they had to be imported from warmer climates-feature in Dutch paintings of the period more than three times as frequently as dairy products do, thereby casting doubt on the idea that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. dairy products were a more significant component of the Dutch diet of the period than lemons were.
B. food was a more popular subject among Dutch painters than it was among painters from other countries at the time.
C. depictions of food in Dutch paintings of the period should be taken as realistic representations of Dutch eating habits.
D. Dutch painters of the period may have depicted foods for symbolic reasons rather than to show what Dutch people typically ate.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The text tells us that lemons-an expensive imported product-feature in Dutch paintings of the period more frequently than dairy products do. Since it's unlikely lemons were eaten more often than dairy, this fact casts doubt on the theory that these paintings realistically depicted Dutch diets.
* **Incorrect (A):** In fact, the text suggests the opposite: it says that dairy products were a "major component of the Dutch diet," while lemons were an expensive import item, so we can infer that lemons were eaten much more rarely than dairy products.
* **Incorrect (B):** The passage doesn't mention painters from other countries, so there's no basis to make this inference.
* **Incorrect (D):** In fact, the text suggests that Dutch painters do have reasons for depicting foods other than to show what Dutch people typically ate. For example, lemons in a painting could indicate wealth or prosperity.
