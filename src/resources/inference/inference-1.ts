**Passage:**
Microbes that live in shallow lakes and ponds produce methane, a harmful greenhouse gas. Ecologist Ralf Aben and his team wanted to see how different types of shallow-water plants might affect the amount of methane that escapes into the atmosphere. Aben's team set up some water tanks with soil and microbes from local ponds. Some tanks had a type of underwater plant that grows in the soil called watermilfoil. Other tanks had either duckweed, a type of plant that floats on the water's surface, or algae. Aben and his team found that tanks with duckweed and algae released higher levels of methane than tanks with watermilfoil did. This finding suggests that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. the presence of some kinds of underwater plants like watermilfoil helps prevent methane from escaping shallow lakes and ponds.
B. shallow lakes and ponds release more methane than deeper bodies of water because shallow bodies of water usually have more plants than deep bodies of water do.
C. shallow lakes and ponds are more likely to contain algae than to contain either watermilfoil or duckweed.
D. having a mix of algae, underwater plants, and floating plants is the best way to reduce the amount of methane in shallow lakes and ponds.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The passage tells us that "tanks with duckweed (a floating plant) and algae released higher levels of methane than tanks with watermilfoil (an underwater plant) did." This suggests that the presence of some kinds of underwater plants like watermilfoil may help prevent methane from escaping shallow lakes and ponds.
* **Incorrect (B):** The passage doesn't mention deeper bodies of water at all, so there's no basis for this inference.
* **Incorrect (C):** The passage doesn't compare the likelihood of shallow lakes and ponds containing algae, watermilfoil, or duckweed.
* **Incorrect (D):** The study didn't include any tanks with a mix of plants, so there's no basis for this inference.

### Question 2 of 3 ###
**Passage:**
In their book Smart Pricing, Jagmohan Raju and Z. John Zhang consider musicians' use of the nontraditional "pay as you wish" pricing model. This model generally offers listeners the choice to pay more or less than a suggested price for a song or album-or even to pay nothing at all. As the authors note, that's the option most listeners chose for an album by the band Harvey Danger. Only about 1% opted to pay for the album, resulting in earnings below the band's expectations. But the authors also discuss musician Jane Siberry, who saw significant earnings from her "pay as you wish" online music store as a result of many listeners choosing to pay more than the store's suggested prices. Hence, the "pay as you wish" model may ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. prove financially successful for some musicians but disappointing for others.
B. hold greater financial appeal for bands than for individual musicians.
C. cause most musicians who use the model to lower the suggested prices of their songs and albums over time.
D. more strongly reflect differences in certain musicians' popularity than traditional pricing models do.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** In one example, musicians made less money than expected by using the "pay as you wish" model. In the other example, a musician made more money than expected. This suggests that some musicians may have more success than others using the "pay as you wish" model.
* **Incorrect (B):** This inference isn't supported. In the examples provided, the individual musician was more successful with the "pay as you wish" model than the band was.
* **Incorrect (C):** This inference isn't supported. The passage provides no instances in which musicians changed the suggested prices of their songs or albums, nor does it mention this as a possibility.
* **Incorrect (D):** This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses the differences in popularity of different musicians, so there is no basis to make this inference.

### Question 3 of 3 ###
**Passage:**
Arthur Conan Doyle's stories about detective Sherlock Holmes were published between 1887 and 1927. They have inspired countless successful adaptations, including comic strips, movies, and a television series Sherlock Hound, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who is celebrated for his animated movies. Until 2014, these stories were copyrighted. The right to adapt was only available to those who could afford the copyright fee and gain approval from the strict copyright holders of Doyle's estate. Some journalists predict that the number of Sherlock Holmes adaptations is likely to increase since the end of copyright means that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. Doyle's original stories will become hard to find.
B. people will become more interested in detective stories than they were in the 1800s.
C. producing adaptations will become easier and less expensive.
D. the former copyright holders of Doyle's estate will return fees they collected.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The text tells us that because of the copyright, adapting Sherlock Holmes stories used to be expensive and difficult. This suggests that after the copyright ends, it will be less expensive and less difficult to adapt these stories.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text never suggests that the copyright ending will make Sherlock Holmes stories harder to find. Instead, it suggests that adaptations of these stories will be easier and less expensive to make.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text never discusses people's interest in detective stories, so there is no basis to make this inference.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text never suggests that copyright fees from the past are returned after a copyright ends, so there is no basis to make this inference.
