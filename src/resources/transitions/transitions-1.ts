**Passage:**
It has long been thought that humans first crossed a land bridge into the Americas approximately 13,000 years ago. ___________, based on radiocarbon dating of samples uncovered in Mexico, a research team recently suggested that humans may have arrived more than 30,000 years ago-much earlier than previously thought.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. As a result,
B. Similarly,
C. However,
D. In conclusion,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "However" correctly introduces a contrasting idea. The first sentence presents a long-held theory (arrival 13,000 years ago), while the second sentence introduces a new, conflicting theory (arrival over 30,000 years ago).
* **Incorrect (A):** "As a result" incorrectly suggests that the second theory is a consequence of the first. The new theory actually contradicts the old one.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Similarly" incorrectly suggests the two theories are alike. The new finding of a much earlier arrival date contrasts with the previous estimate.
* **Incorrect (D):** "In conclusion" incorrectly suggests a summary or conclusion of the first theory. The second sentence presents a contrasting viewpoint, not a conclusion.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Researchers believe that pieces of hull found off Oregon's coast are from a Spanish cargo ship that was lost in 1697. Stories passed down among the area's Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians support this belief. ___________, Siletz stories describe how blocks of beeswax, an item the ship had been carrying, began washing ashore after the ship was lost.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. For this reason,
B. For example,
C. However,
D. Likewise,

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "For example" logically introduces the story about beeswax as a specific example that supports the preceding claim that Siletz stories corroborate the shipwreck theory.
* **Incorrect (A):** "For this reason" incorrectly implies that the beeswax stories were caused by the claim that Siletz stories support the theory. The stories are evidence for the claim, not a result of it.
* **Incorrect (C):** "However" incorrectly signals a contrast. The beeswax stories support the previous statement, they do not contradict it.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Likewise" incorrectly suggests that the beeswax stories are a separate but similar claim. The stories are a specific example supporting the main point.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Before the 1847 introduction of the US postage stamp, the cost of postage was usually paid by the recipient of a letter rather than the sender, and recipients were not always able or willing to pay promptly. ___________, collecting this fee could be slow and arduous, and heaps of unpaid-for, undeliverable mail piled up in post offices.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. Regardless,
B. On the contrary,
C. Consequently,
D. For example,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "Consequently" correctly establishes a cause-and-effect relationship. The difficulties in collecting fees and the piling up of mail were a direct result of the postage system where the recipient had to pay.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Regardless" incorrectly suggests the problems occurred despite the fee system, when in fact they were caused by it.
* **Incorrect (B):** "On the contrary" incorrectly introduces a contrasting idea. The second sentence describes the results of the system, not a contradiction of it.
* **Incorrect (D):** "For example" incorrectly suggests the problems were an example of the fee system itself. They were a consequence of it.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
A potter choosing which type of clay to use for a piece considers two key factors: the desired look of the piece and its intended use. ___________, earthenware clay is often used for decorative pieces because of its rustic look. This type of clay is not often used in industrial settings, though, because it is less durable than other clays.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. In other words,
B. Regardless,
C. In conclusion,
D. For example,

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "For example" logically introduces the use of earthenware clay as a specific illustration of the general principle stated in the first sentence (selecting clay based on look and use).
* **Incorrect (A):** "In other words" is used for restating an idea. The second sentence provides a specific example, not a restatement of the initial claim.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Regardless" introduces a conflicting point. The use of earthenware for its look agrees with and supports the initial statement.
* **Incorrect (C):** "In conclusion" is used to summarize. The second sentence does not summarize the first; it provides a specific case.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In Gothic architecture, flying buttresses are large arches that help support a building's exterior walls. Before the Gothic era, cathedrals' heavy ceilings had to be supported by thick, short walls, but the invention of flying buttresses eliminated this need. ___________, Gothic cathedrals could be built with thinner, higher walls.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. Similarly,
B. For instance,
C. Nevertheless,
D. As a result,

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "As a result" correctly indicates that the ability to build thinner, higher walls was a consequence of the invention of flying buttresses.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Similarly" incorrectly suggests a comparison. The thinner walls were a result of the invention, not a similar concept.
* **Incorrect (B):** "For instance" incorrectly presents the thinner walls as an example of the invention itself. The walls were made possible by the invention.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Nevertheless" incorrectly implies that thinner walls were built despite the invention. They were built because of it.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Tyrian purple was a highly prized dye among the Phoenicians (an ancient civilization located in present-day Lebanon). The Phoenicians were famous for using this natural dye to color their clothes a distinctive purple. ___________, "Phoenicia" itself, some historians claim, may have originally meant "land of purple."

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. In fact,
B. Regardless,
C. Lastly,
D. On the contrary,

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** "In fact" is used to introduce a piece of information that emphasizes or reinforces the previous statement. The possibility that "Phoenicia" means "land of purple" strongly supports the idea that the Phoenicians were famous for their purple dye.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Regardless" incorrectly signals a contrast. The potential origin of the name "Phoenicia" supports, rather than contradicts, the previous claim.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Lastly" incorrectly implies this is the final point in a sequence. The sentence's purpose is to add emphasis, not to conclude a list of steps.
* **Incorrect (D):** "On the contrary" incorrectly signals a direct opposition. The naming of the land supports the claim about the dye, it does not oppose it.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
As a young historian in the 1950s, Alixa Naff began interviewing fellow Arab American immigrants about their experiences straddling two cultures. Over the next few decades, Naff conducted more than 450 such interviews, also known as oral histories. ___________, she collected photographs and other artifacts that represented her subjects' experiences.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. In other words,
B. On the contrary,
C. In addition,
D. Today,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "In addition" logically signals that collecting artifacts was another activity Naff undertook, separate from but related to her work of conducting interviews.
* **Incorrect (A):** "In other words" would incorrectly imply that collecting artifacts is just another way of saying she conducted interviews. These were two distinct activities.
* **Incorrect (B):** "On the contrary" would incorrectly suggest that collecting artifacts was in opposition to conducting interviews. Both activities were part of her research.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Today" incorrectly shifts the timeframe to the present. The verb "collected" indicates this action, like the interviews, happened in the past.
