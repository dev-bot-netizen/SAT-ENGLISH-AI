**Passage:**
Most of the planets that have been discovered outside our solar system orbit G-type stars, like our Sun. ___________, in 2014, researchers identified a planet orbiting KELT-9, a B-type star more than twice as massive and nearly twice as hot as the Sun. Called KELT-9b, it is one of the hottest planets ever discovered.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. likewise,
B. however,
C. therefore,
D. for example,

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "however" correctly introduces information that contrasts with the preceding statement. The first sentence establishes a general rule (most exoplanets orbit G-type stars), and the second sentence introduces an exception (a planet orbiting a B-type star).
* **Incorrect (A):** "likewise" incorrectly suggests a similarity. The discovery of a planet around a B-type star is a contrast to the norm, not a similar case.
* **Incorrect (C):** "therefore" incorrectly implies a cause-and-effect relationship. The discovery of KELT-9b is not a result of most planets orbiting G-type stars.
* **Incorrect (D):** "for example" incorrectly suggests that KELT-9b is an example of the rule. It is an exception to it.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In 1873, Spanish scientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal observed that brain fibers have distinct boundaries with clear end points, a finding that went against earlier assumptions about the brain. ___________, scientists had assumed that the brain was a continuous web of fused fibers, not a vast network of distinct, individual cells.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. However,
B. Previously,
C. As a result,
D. Likewise,

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "Previously" correctly establishes the time relationship, indicating that the belief in a "continuous web" was the assumption held before Ramón y Cajal's discovery in 1873.
* **Incorrect (A):** "However" is illogical here. The first sentence already states that the finding "went against earlier assumptions," so the second sentence, which describes one of those assumptions, is elaborating on that point, not contrasting with it.
* **Incorrect (C):** "As a result" incorrectly suggests the old theory was a result of the new discovery. The old theory came before the discovery.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Likewise" incorrectly suggests the old theory was similar to the new discovery. The two ideas are opposites.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
For years, biologists have experimented with using grime-eating bacteria rather than harsh chemicals to clean artworks, and results have been impressive overall. ___________, these bacterial strains-which can metabolize centuries' worth of oil, glue, dirt, and other surface impurities without creating harmful byproducts-have proven more effective than traditional chemical cleaning methods.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. However,
B. In many cases,
C. As a result,
D. Additionally,

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "In many cases" appropriately introduces specific findings that support the general claim made in the first sentence. The first sentence says the results were "impressive overall," and the second provides details on their effectiveness in many instances.
* **Incorrect (A):** "However" incorrectly signals a contrast. The second sentence agrees with and provides evidence for the first.
* **Incorrect (C):** "As a result" incorrectly implies causation. The effectiveness of the bacteria is the reason the results are impressive; it is not caused by the impressiveness.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Additionally" incorrectly suggests a new, separate idea is being introduced. The second sentence elaborates on the "impressive results" already mentioned.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Alexander Lawrence Posey (1873-1908) varied his focus and tone depending on the genre in which he was writing. In his poetry, he used heartfelt language to evoke the beauty and peacefulness of his natural surroundings; in his journalism, ___________, he employed humor and satire to comment on political issues affecting his Muskogee Creek community.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. that is,
B. granted,
C. similarly,
D. by contrast,

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "by contrast" perfectly captures the relationship between the two styles described. The "heartfelt language" of his poetry is presented as being very different from the "humor and satire" of his journalism.
* **Incorrect (A):** "that is" incorrectly suggests a restatement. The description of his journalistic style is a second, different example, not a rephrasing of his poetic style.
* **Incorrect (B):** "granted" is used to concede a point, which is not happening here. The text is simply providing two different examples to support the initial claim.
* **Incorrect (C):** "similarly" incorrectly suggests the two styles are alike. The text deliberately highlights their differences to show how Posey's tone varied.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Okot p'Bitek's poem Song of Lawino (1966) explores postcolonial Ugandan life through the eyes of a woman living in a rural village. With its vibrant imagery, bitingly satiric tone, and dexterous use of traditional Acholi song and phraseology, the poem inspired a generation of East African writers. ___________, those who adopted its style are often referred to as Okot School poets.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. Nevertheless,
B. Fittingly,
C. By comparison,
D. Instead,

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "Fittingly" means appropriately or suitably. It is logical and appropriate that writers who were inspired by and adopted Okot p'Bitek's style would be named the "Okot School poets" in his honor.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Nevertheless" incorrectly introduces a contrasting idea. The naming of the school supports the idea of his influence; it does not contrast with it.
* **Incorrect (C):** "By comparison" incorrectly suggests a comparison is being made. The sentence explains a direct result of his influence, not a comparison to it.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Instead" incorrectly signals a replacement or disagreement. The naming of the school is a logical outcome of his influence.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Because an achiral molecule is symmetrical, flipping it yields a structurally identical molecule. A flipped chiral molecule, ___________, can be compared to a glove that has been turned inside out: it produces a structurally inverted molecule rather than an identical one.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. in other words,
B. by contrast,
C. for example,
D. similarly,

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "by contrast" correctly highlights the difference between what happens when an achiral molecule is flipped (it remains identical) and what happens when a chiral molecule is flipped (it becomes inverted).
* **Incorrect (A):** "in other words" incorrectly implies a restatement. The second sentence introduces a new point about a different type of molecule (chiral).
* **Incorrect (C):** "for example" is incorrect because the behavior of a chiral molecule is not an example of the behavior of an achiral molecule; it's a contrast.
* **Incorrect (D):** "similarly" is incorrect because the outcome of flipping a chiral molecule is the opposite of flipping an achiral one.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Jhumpa Lahiri's story collection Interpreter of Maladies features multiple stories about romantic relationships. In "This Blessed House," newlyweds argue over whether to replace items left by the previous owners of their new home. ___________, in "A Temporary Matter," a husband and wife attempt to rekindle their relationship during a four-night blackout.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. Granted,
B. For example,
C. Likewise,
D. Hence,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "Likewise" is used to introduce another example that is similar to the first. Both "This Blessed House" and "A Temporary Matter" are presented as examples of stories about romantic relationships in the collection. The transition connects the two similar examples.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Granted" is used to concede a point, which is not the function here. The text is adding another supporting example.
* **Incorrect (B):** "For example" would be redundant and illogical. The second story is not an example of the first story; it's another, similar example of the main idea stated in the first sentence.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Hence" incorrectly implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the two stories.
