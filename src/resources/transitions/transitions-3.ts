**Passage:**
In a heated debate in biogeography, the field is divided between dispersalists and vicariancists. ___________, there are those who argue that dispersal is the most crucial determining factor in a species' distribution, and those who insist that vicariance (separation due to geographic barriers) is. Biogeographer Isabel Sanmartín counts herself among neither.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. Furthermore,
B. By contrast,
C. Similarly,
D. That is,

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "That is" correctly signals that the sentence to follow will clarify or explain the terms of the debate mentioned in the first sentence. It defines what "dispersalists" and "vicariancists" believe.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Furthermore" incorrectly suggests that an additional, separate point is being made. The sentence is clarifying the preceding one, not adding to it.
* **Incorrect (B):** "By contrast" incorrectly suggests that the explanation of the two sides contrasts with the statement that there is a debate. The explanation defines the debate.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Similarly" incorrectly suggests the explanation is merely similar to the statement about the debate. It is a direct clarification.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In 1815, while in exile in Jamaica, Venezuelan revolutionary Simón Bolívar penned a letter praising England's republican government and expressing hope that Latin American nations seeking independence from Spain might achieve something similar. The letter was addressed to a local merchant, Henry Cullen; ___________, though, Bolívar's goal was to persuade political leaders from England and Europe to support his cause.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. additionally,
B. ultimately,
C. accordingly,
D. consequently,

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "Ultimately" correctly signifies Bolívar's final or highest-level goal. While the letter was addressed to a merchant, its intended, long-term purpose was to reach and persuade European leaders.
* **Incorrect (A):** "additionally" would incorrectly suggest adding a similar idea. The word "though" signals a contrast between the immediate audience (Cullen) and the real target.
* **Incorrect (C):** "accordingly" incorrectly implies a cause-and-effect relationship. Addressing the letter to Cullen didn't cause him to have the larger goal.
* **Incorrect (D):** "consequently" incorrectly implies a cause-and-effect relationship, which is not the logical connection here.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In 2009, the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles hosted a special exhibition, Sueños/Yume, showcasing the works of local sculptor Dora de Larios. As suggested by the show's title (sueños and yume mean "dreams" in Spanish and Japanese, respectively), de Larios's art reflects a mix of cultural influences. ___________, her work is grounded in the artistic traditions of both Mexico and Japan.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. In addition,
B. In contrast,
C. Specifically,
D. Therefore,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "Specifically" logically indicates that the second sentence will provide precise details about the "mix of cultural influences" mentioned in the previous sentence, identifying them as Mexican and Japanese traditions.
* **Incorrect (A):** "In addition" would incorrectly suggest a new, separate point is being introduced, rather than an elaboration of the previous claim.
* **Incorrect (B):** "In contrast" incorrectly signals a contradiction. Naming the specific cultures supports, not contradicts, the claim of mixed influences.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Therefore" incorrectly implies a cause-and-effect relationship. The grounding in Mexican and Japanese traditions is the nature of the cultural mix, not a result of it.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
When one looks at the dark craggy vistas in Hitoshi Fugo's evocative photo series, one's mind might wander off to the cratered surfaces of faraway planets. ___________, it's the series' title, Flying Frying Pan, that brings one back to Earth, reminding the viewer that each photo is actually a close-up view of a familiar household object: a frying pan.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. Consequently,
B. Alternatively,
C. Ultimately,
D. Additionally,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "Ultimately" means "in the end" or "eventually," which fits the sequence of the viewer's experience. First, the viewer imagines planets, but in the end, the title reveals the true subject and brings them back to reality.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Consequently" incorrectly suggests that the title's revelation is a result of the viewer's initial imaginative response. The two experiences are sequential but not causal.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Alternatively" incorrectly suggests another option or possibility. The viewer has both experiences in sequence, one after the other.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Additionally" incorrectly suggests the second experience is a similar, added idea. In fact, the second experience (realizing it's a frying pan) is the opposite of the first (imagining a planet).

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Plato believed material objects to be crude representations of unseen ideal forms. In his view, such abstract, nonmaterial forms are the ultimate source of knowledge. Aristotle disagreed, positing that knowledge is best obtained through direct engagement with the material world; ___________, sensory experience of the material is the ultimate source of knowledge.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. regardless,
B. admittedly,
C. in other words,
D. meanwhile,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "in other words" correctly signals that the final clause is a restatement or clarification of Aristotle's position mentioned just before the semicolon—that "sensory experience" is how one has "direct engagement with the material world."
* **Incorrect (A):** "regardless" would incorrectly suggest that the final clause is true in spite of Aristotle's theory, when it is actually a restatement of it.
* **Incorrect (B):** "admittedly" would incorrectly suggest the final clause is an exception or concession, but it's a clarification of the same idea.
* **Incorrect (D):** "meanwhile" incorrectly implies a separate, simultaneous action. The clause is a direct rephrasing of Aristotle's view, not a separate thought.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Magnetic levitation (maglev) trains are suspended above a track by powerful electromagnets, reducing friction and thus allowing for much faster speeds. Though maglev advocates in the US have long imagined these trains crisscrossing the country, their dream remains unrealized. ___________, of the handful of maglev trains currently in operation, all are in Asia.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. In fact,
B. To that end,
C. Nevertheless,
D. That said,

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** "In fact" is used to emphasize the truth of a statement that modifies or strengthens the previous one. The fact that all operating maglev trains are in Asia emphasizes just how "unrealized" the dream is in the US.
* **Incorrect (B):** "To that end" incorrectly suggests a cause-and-effect relationship aimed at achieving a goal. The location of existing trains isn't done to make the US dream unrealized.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Nevertheless" incorrectly signals a disagreement. The second sentence agrees with and reinforces the first by providing specific evidence.
* **Incorrect (D):** "That said" also signals a disagreement or concession, which is not the relationship between these two sentences. Both highlight the lack of maglev trains in the US.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Iraqi artist Nazik Al-Malaika, celebrated as the first Arabic poet to write in free verse, didn't reject traditional forms entirely; her poem "Elegy for a Woman of No Importance" consists of two ten-line stanzas and a standard number of syllables. ___________, even in this superficially traditional work, Al-Malaika was breaking new ground by memorializing an anonymous woman rather than a famous man.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. therefore,
B. in fact,
C. moreover,
D. though,

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "though" correctly introduces a contrast. The first part of the passage establishes that she used a "superficially traditional" form. The second part explains that despite this traditional form, the poem's content was "breaking new ground." "Though" signals this contrast.
* **Incorrect (A):** "therefore" incorrectly suggests a cause-and-effect relationship. Her innovation was not a result of using a traditional form.
* **Incorrect (B):** "in fact" is used to emphasize the truth of a preceding statement. Here, a contrast is needed, not an emphasis of the poem's traditional structure.
* **Incorrect (C):** "moreover" incorrectly suggests adding a similar or supporting idea. The idea of "breaking new ground" contrasts with the idea of using a "traditional" structure.
