**Passage:**
While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Organisms release cellular material into their environment by shedding substances such as hair or skin.
- The DNA in these substances is known as environmental DNA, or eDNA.
- Researchers collect and analyze eDNA to detect the presence of species that are difficult to observe.
- Geneticist Sara Oyler-McCance's research team analyzed eDNA in water samples from the Florida Everglades to detect invasive constrictor snake species in the area.
- The study determined a 91% probability of detecting Burmese python eDNA in a given location.

**Question:**
The student wants to present the study to an audience already familiar with environmental DNA. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

**Options:**
A. Sara Oyler-McCance's researchers analyzed eDNA in water samples from the Florida Everglades for evidence of invasive constrictor snakes, which are difficult to observe.
B. An analysis of eDNA can detect the presence of invasive species that are difficult to observe, such as constrictor snakes.
C. Researchers found Burmese python eDNA, or environmental DNA, in water samples; eDNA is the DNA in released cellular materials, such as shed skin cells.
D. Sara Oyler-McCance's researchers analyzed environmental DNA (eDNA)-that is, DNA from cellular materials released by organisms-in water samples from the Florida Everglades.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This choice presents the study in a way that assumes the audience is already familiar with eDNA.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice doesn't present the study. It only states a general fact about eDNA analysis.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice isn't suited for an audience already familiar with eDNA. A familiar audience wouldn't need to have the term defined or explained.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice isn't suited for an audience already familiar with eDNA. A familiar audience wouldn't need to have the term defined or explained. It also doesn't present the study.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Species belonging to the Orchidaceae (orchid) family can be found in both tropical and temperate environments.
- Orchidaceae species diversity has not been well studied in temperate forests, such as those in Oaxaca, Mexico.
- Arelee Estefanía Muñoz-Hernández led a study to determine how many different Orchidaceae species are present in the forests of Oaxaca.
- Muñoz-Hernández and her team collected orchids each month for a year at a site in Oaxaca.
- Seventy-four Orchidaceae species were present at the site.

**Question:**
The student wants to present the study and its findings. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

**Options:**
A. A study led by Arelee Estefanía Muñoz-Hernández identified a total of 74 Orchidaceae species in the temperate forests of Oaxaca, Mexico.
B. There are orchids in many environments, but there are 74 Orchidaceae species in Oaxaca, Mexico.
C. Oaxaca, Mexico, is home to temperate forests containing 74 Orchidaceae species.
D. Arelee Estefanía Muñoz-Hernández and her team wanted to know how many different Orchidaceae species are present in the forests of Oaxaca, Mexico, so they conducted a study to collect orchids.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This choice most effectively presents the study and its findings. It opens with the study and names its lead researcher, then tells us its finding: that they identified 74 Orchidaceae species in the temperate forests of Oaxaca, Mexico.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice doesn't include the study's findings, so it fails to achieve the goal. It doesn't mention that there was a study at all.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice doesn't present the study, so it fails to achieve the goal. It doesn't mention that there was a study at all.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice doesn't include the study's findings, so it fails to achieve the goal.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Platinum is a rare and expensive metal.
- It is used as a catalyst for chemical reactions.
- Platinum catalysts typically require a large amount of platinum to be effective.
- Researcher Jianbo Tang and his colleagues created a platinum catalyst that combines platinum with liquid gallium.
- Their catalyst was highly effective and required only trace amounts of platinum (0.0001% of the atoms in the mixture).

**Question:**
The student wants to explain an advantage of the new platinum catalyst developed by Jianbo Tang and his colleagues. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

**Options:**
A. Researcher Jianbo Tang and his colleagues created a platinum catalyst that combines platinum, a rare and expensive metal, with liquid gallium.
B. Like other platinum catalysts, the new platinum catalyst requires a particular amount of the metal to be effective.
C. Platinum is a rare and expensive metal that is used as a catalyst for chemical reactions; however, platinum catalysts typically require a large amount of platinum to be effective.
D. While still highly effective, the new platinum catalyst requires far less of the rare and expensive metal than do other platinum catalysts.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The sentence explains an advantage of Tang and his colleagues' platinum catalyst, noting that it requires far less platinum (which is rare and expensive) than other platinum catalysts do.
* **Incorrect (A):** The sentence describes the platinum catalyst that Tang and his colleagues created; it doesn't explain an advantage of their platinum catalyst.
* **Incorrect (B):** The sentence emphasizes a similarity between the new platinum catalyst and other platinum catalysts; it doesn't explain an advantage of the new platinum catalyst.
* **Incorrect (C):** The sentence connects the metal platinum to the functioning of platinum catalysts, noting that large amounts of platinum are typically required for platinum catalysts to be effective; it doesn't explain an advantage of Tang and his colleagues' platinum catalyst.

C. Many other artists have been influenced by the style of Houser's sculptures.
D. The sculpture Sacred Rain Arrow is a well-known example of Houser's style.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The sentence describes the distinctive style of Houser's sculptures, explaining that the sculptures use abstract, modernist forms to depict Native American figures.
* **Incorrect (A):** While the sentence indicates that Houser developed a distinctive style for portraying Native American figures, it doesn't describe this style.
* **Incorrect (C):** While the sentence states that other artists have been influenced by the style of Houser's sculptures, it doesn't describe this style.
* **Incorrect (D):** While the sentence mentions the name of a sculpture that's a well-known example of Houser's style, it doesn't describe the sculpture's style.
