**Passage:**
While one requires oxygen and one does _______ and anaerobic respiration are both forms of cellular respirationâ€”that is, they are processes by which cells break down glucose to use as energy.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. not aerobic
B. not. Aerobic
C. not, aerobic
D. not; aerobic

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** A comma is the appropriate way to link the dependent clause "While...not" and the independent clause that follows.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice creates a run-on sentence error. "While...not" is a dependent clause, which must be separated from the independent clause that follows with some sort of punctuation.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice creates a sentence fragment. "While one requires oxygen and one does not" isn't an independent clause, so it can't stand alone as a complete sentence.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice creates a punctuation error. "While one requires oxygen and one does not" isn't an independent clause, so it can't be linked to the clause that follows with a semicolon.

### Question 2 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Scent is tightly interwoven with our daily lives, often evoking significant memories and important social events. This connection is of growing interest to archaeologists who hope to use it to better understand ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine. Although the speed at which odor molecules dissipate makes identifying ancient scents challenging, advancements in biomolecular technologies show promise in unlocking ancient aromas from preserved artifacts. Archaeological studies making use of these advancements may provide new insights into past societies.

**Question:**
According to the text, what is one reason some archaeologists are interested in recovering scents from ancient artifacts?

**Options:**
A. They are investigating whether people's sense of smell has declined in recent centuries.
B. They believe the scents could illuminate important aspects of ancient life.
C. They think that ancient scents would be enjoyable to people today.
D. They hope to develop new medicines using ancient scent molecules.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** This is the best answer because the text states that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand "ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine," which are all important aspects of ancient life.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text does not mention anything about investigating whether people's sense of smell has declined. It only mentions that scents fade over time.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text does not say anything about ancient scents being enjoyable to people today.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not mention developing new medicines. Instead, it says that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand "ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine".

### Question 3 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Historians studying pre-Inca Peru have looked to ceramic vessels to understand daily life among the Moche people. These mold-made sculptures present plants, animals, and human faces in precise ways-vessels representing human faces are so detailed that scholars have interpreted facial markings to represent scars and other skin irregularities. Some historians have even used these objects to identify potential skin diseases that may have afflicted people at the time.

Text 2
Art historian and archaeologist Lisa Trever has argued that the interpretation of Moche "portrait" vessels as hyper-realistic portrayals of identifiable people may inadvertently disregard the creativity of the objects' creators. Moche ceramic vessels, Trever argues, are artworks in which sculptors could free their imagination, using realistic objects and people around them as inspiration to explore more abstract concepts.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, what would Lisa Trever (Text 2) most likely say about the interpretation presented in the underlined portion of Text 1?

**Options:**
A. Depictions of human faces are significantly more realistic than depictions of plants and other animals are.
B. It is likely that some depictions of human faces with extensive markings are intended to portray the same historical individual.
C. Some vessels may have been damaged during their excavation and thus provide little insight into Moche culture.
D. Markings on depictions of human faces are not necessarily intended to portray particular details about the physical appearance of individuals.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** Trever thinks that the "hyper-realistic portrayal of identifiable people" interpretation ignores the sculptors' imagination and creativity. We can infer that Trever thinks the facial markings on the sculptures may not have represented real skin blemishes on real people.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text compares the depictions of human faces to the depictions of plants or animals, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. There's nothing in either text about multiple depictions representing the same person, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text mentions the state of the vessels (damaged or intact), so we have no basis to draw this conclusion.

### Question 4 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Farouk El-Baz, a geologist and space scientist, ______ part of the team that selected the lunar landing sites for the Apollo program during the 1960s and 1970s.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. are
B. was
C. have been
D. were

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement. The singular verb "was" agrees in number with the singular subject "Farouk El-Baz."
* **Incorrect (A):** The plural verb "are" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "Farouk El-Baz."
* **Incorrect (C):** The plural verb "have been" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "Farouk El-Baz."
* **Incorrect (D):** The plural verb "were" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "Farouk El-Baz."

### Question 5 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Arthur Conan Doyle's stories about detective Sherlock Holmes were published between 1887 and 1927. They have inspired countless successful adaptations, including comic strips, movies, and a television series Sherlock Hound, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who is celebrated for his animated movies. Until 2014, these stories were copyrighted. The right to adapt was only available to those who could afford the copyright fee and gain approval from the strict copyright holders of Doyle's estate. Some journalists predict that the number of Sherlock Holmes adaptations is likely to increase since the end of copyright means that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. Doyle's original stories will become hard to find.
B. people will become more interested in detective stories than they were in the 1800s.
C. producing adaptations will become easier and less expensive.
D. the former copyright holders of Doyle's estate will return fees they collected.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The text tells us that because of the copyright, adapting Sherlock Holmes stories used to be expensive and difficult. This suggests that after the copyright ends, it will be less expensive and less difficult to adapt these stories.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text never suggests that the copyright ending will make Sherlock Holmes stories harder to find. Instead, it suggests that adaptations of these stories will be easier and less expensive to make.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text never discusses people's interest in detective stories, so there is no basis to make this inference.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text never suggests that copyright fees from the past are returned after a copyright ends, so there is no basis to make this inference.

D. Simphiwe Ndzube's Assertion of Will was one of eight artworks exhibited in Oracles of the Pink Universe at the Denver Museum of Art.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This choice directly describes how fabric is used in Assertion of Will, by explaining that the fabric pieces are part of the painting itself.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice provides contextual information about the exhibition, but it doesn't mention anything about the painting or the fabric.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice mentions that the figures are clothed, but it doesn't explain how the fabric is integrated into the painting.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice provides contextual information about the painting, but it doesn't mention anything about the fabric or how it is used.

### Question 7 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde's 1897 nonfiction work De Profundis.

People whose desire is solely for self-realisation never know where they are going. They can't know. In one sense of the word it is of course necessary to know oneself: that is the first achievement of knowledge. But to recognise that the soul of a man is unknowable, is the ultimate achievement of wisdom. The final mystery is oneself. When one has weighed the sun in the balance, and measured the steps of the moon, and mapped out the seven heavens star by star, there still remains oneself. <u>Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul?</u>

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole?

**Options:**
A. It reinforces the text's skepticism about the possibility of truly achieving self-knowledge.
B. It speculates that some readers will share the doubts expressed in the text about the value of self-knowledge.
C. It cautions readers that the text's directions for how to achieve self-knowledge are hard to follow.
D. It concedes that the definition of self-knowledge advanced in the text is unpopular.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This is the best answer. The text repeatedly claims that true self-knowledge is impossible to achieve, and the final rhetorical question emphasizes this point.
* **Incorrect (B):** The question doesn't speculate about readers' doubts on the value of self-knowledge, but rather on the possibility of achieving it.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text does not provide instructions on how to achieve self-knowledge; on the contrary, it argues that it is impossible.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not define self-knowledge or comment on its popularity.

### Question 8 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
It has long been thought that humans first crossed a land bridge into the Americas approximately 13,000 years ago. ___________, based on radiocarbon dating of samples uncovered in Mexico, a research team recently suggested that humans may have arrived more than 30,000 years ago-much earlier than previously thought.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. As a result,
B. Similarly,
C. However,
D. In conclusion,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "However" correctly introduces a contrasting idea. The first sentence presents a long-held theory (arrival 13,000 years ago), while the second sentence introduces a new, conflicting theory (arrival over 30,000 years ago).
* **Incorrect (A):** "As a result" incorrectly suggests that the second theory is a consequence of the first. The new theory actually contradicts the old one.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Similarly" incorrectly suggests the two theories are alike. The new finding of a much earlier arrival date contrasts with the previous estimate.
* **Incorrect (D):** "In conclusion" incorrectly suggests a summary or conclusion of the first theory. The second sentence presents a contrasting viewpoint, not a conclusion.

### Question 9 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
In the 1970s, video cameras became increasingly affordable for ordinary consumers and gave Ulysses Jenkins and other artists capabilities that were previously unavailable except to television broadcasters. Jenkins recognized and took full advantage of this ___________ access to powerful technology to create groundbreaking works of video art, such as Mass of Images (1978).

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. newfound
B. delicate
C. inevitable
D. habitual

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** "Newfound" means recently discovered or established. The text explains that video cameras had only recently become affordable and available to artists like Jenkins, making his access to this technology "newfound."
* **Incorrect (B):** "Delicate," meaning easily broken or fine in texture, does not make sense in the context of access to technology.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Inevitable" means unavoidable, but the text doesn't discuss the likelihood of artists gaining this access, only that it happened.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Habitual" means done regularly. Since the access was recent, it was "newfound," not yet habitual.
