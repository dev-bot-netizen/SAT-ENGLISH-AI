**Passage:**
Photosynthesis, the mechanism by which plants use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into _______ is fueled in part by an enzyme called Photosystem II that harvests energy-giving electrons from water molecules.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. nutrients
B. nutrients and
C. nutrients,
D. nutrients-

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary element within a sentence. The comma after "nutrients" pairs with the comma after "photosynthesis" to separate the supplementary element "the mechanism by which plants use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into nutrients" from the rest of the sentence. This supplementary element defines "photosynthesis," and the pair of commas indicates that it could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.
* **Incorrect (B):** A conjunction can't be paired with a comma in this way to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.
* **Incorrect (D):** A dash can't be paired with a comma in this way to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.

### Question 2 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the painted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography's impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of both full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.

**Question:**
Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth century?

**Options:**
A. Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature's decline.
B. Although portrait miniatures became less common than photographs, they were widely regarded as having more artistic merit.
C. The popularity of the portrait miniature likely persisted for longer than art historians have assumed.
D. As demand for portrait miniatures decreased, portrait artists likely shifted their creative focus to photography.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be "overstated," as some records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. From this, we can conclude that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature's decline.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text never discusses the "artistic merit" of either art form.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text never suggests that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought-if anything, it suggests that the portrait miniature started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text never suggests that portrait painters shifted to become photographers.

### Question 3 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Microbes are tiny organisms in the soil, water, and air all around us. They thrive even in very harsh conditions. That's why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn't seem to contain any life. The finding doesn't prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes' survival.

Text 2
Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it's unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer's team's study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn't detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, Fierer's team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?

**Options:**
A. Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures.
B. A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site.
C. Microbes are likely difficult to detect in the soil at the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere.
D. Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** Fierer's team (Text 1) states that their finding suggests the environment "severely restricts microbes' survival". The author of Text 2 agrees that the presence of "so few" organisms would "show how challenging the conditions are". Both texts, therefore, agree that most microbes would be unable to withstand the conditions at the site.
* **Incorrect (A):** Neither text compares how microbes survive in dry versus cold conditions.
* **Incorrect (B):** Text 1 does not indicate that another sample would have different results. While the author of Text 2 suggests microbes may be hard to detect, they do not imply that a new sample would contain a much higher number of them.
* **Incorrect (C):** The author of Text 2 speculates that the microbes were too few to be detected, not that they were smaller than typical microbes. Text 1 does not speculate about the size of the microbes.

### Question 4 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Classical composer Florence Price's 1927 move to Chicago marked a turning point in her career. It was there that Price premiered her First Symphony-a piece that was praised for blending traditional Romantic motifs with aspects of Black folk music-and ______ supportive relationships with other Black artists.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. developing
B. developed
C. to develop
D. having developed

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice creates a verb form error. The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice creates a verb form error. The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice creates a verb form error. The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."

### Question 5 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
In her 2021 article "Throwaway History: Towards a Historiography of Ephemera," scholar Anne Garner discusses John Johnson (1882-1956), a devoted collector of items intended to be discarded, including bus tickets and campaign pamphlets. Johnson recognized that scholarly institutions considered his expansive collection of ephemera to be worthless-indeed, it wasn't until 1968, after Johnson's death, that Oxford University's Bodleian Library acquired the collection, having grasped the items' potential value to historians and other researchers. Hence, the example of Johnson serves to ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. demonstrate the difficulties faced by contemporary historians in conducting research at the Bodleian Library without access to ephemera.
B. represent the challenge of incorporating examples of ephemera into the collections of libraries and other scholarly institutions.
C. lend support to arguments by historians and other researchers who continue to assert that ephemera holds no value for scholars.
D. illustrate both the relatively low scholarly regard in which ephemera was once held and the later recognition of ephemera's possible utility.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** Choice D is the best answer. Johnson collected "ephemera," or things that are meant to be thrown away. Scholars thought his collection was worthless to them, then later realized that it was potentially valuable. This suggests that scholars went from disregarding ephemera to recognizing their usefulness.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text tells us that the Bodleian Library acquired Johnson's large collection of ephemera back in 1968, so we can assume that contemporary historians conducting research there do have access to that collection.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text tells us that "Oxford University's Bodleian Library acquired the collection," but it never suggests that it was a challenge to do so.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text actually suggests the opposite: the example of Johnson's collection lends support to arguments that ephemera does hold value for scholars.

### Question 6 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Organisms release cellular material into their environment by shedding substances such as hair or skin.
- The DNA in these substances is known as environmental DNA, or eDNA.
- Researchers collect and analyze eDNA to detect the presence of species that are difficult to observe.
- Geneticist Sara Oyler-McCance's research team analyzed eDNA in water samples from the Florida Everglades to detect invasive constrictor snake species in the area.
- The study determined a 91% probability of detecting Burmese python eDNA in a given location.

**Question:**
The student wants to present the study to an audience already familiar with environmental DNA. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

**Options:**
A. Sara Oyler-McCance's researchers analyzed eDNA in water samples from the Florida Everglades for evidence of invasive constrictor snakes, which are difficult to observe.
B. An analysis of eDNA can detect the presence of invasive species that are difficult to observe, such as constrictor snakes.
C. Researchers found Burmese python eDNA, or environmental DNA, in water samples; eDNA is the DNA in released cellular materials, such as shed skin cells.
D. Sara Oyler-McCance's researchers analyzed environmental DNA (eDNA)-that is, DNA from cellular materials released by organisms-in water samples from the Florida Everglades.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This choice presents the study in a way that assumes the audience is already familiar with eDNA.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice doesn't present the study. It only states a general fact about eDNA analysis.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice isn't suited for an audience already familiar with eDNA. A familiar audience wouldn't need to have the term defined or explained.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice isn't suited for an audience already familiar with eDNA. A familiar audience wouldn't need to have the term defined or explained. It also doesn't present the study.

### Question 7 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Archeological excavation of Market Street Chinatown, a nineteenth-century Chinese American community in San Jose, California, provided the first evidence that Asian food products were imported to the United States in the 1800s: bones from a freshwater fish species native to Southeast Asia. <u>Jinshanzhuang-Hong Kong-based import/export firms likely coordinated the fish's transport from Chinese-operated fisheries in Vietnam and Malaysia to North American markets.</u> This route reveals the (often overlooked) multinational dimensions of the trade networks linking Chinese diaspora communities.

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

**Options:**
A. It explains why efforts to determine the country of origin of the items mentioned in the previous sentence remain inconclusive.
B. It provides information that helps support a claim about a discovery's significance that is presented in the following sentence.
C. It traces the steps that were taken to locate and recover the objects that are described in the previous sentence.
D. It outlines a hypothesis that additional evidence discussed in the following sentence casts some doubt on.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** This is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides details about the import/export firms and trade routes, which shows how different Chinese communities were connected. This information directly supports the claim in the final sentence about the "multinational dimensions" of the trade networks.
* **Incorrect (A):** The underlined sentence does not suggest the origin is inconclusive; in fact, it specifies the countries of origin (Vietnam and Malaysia).
* **Incorrect (C):** The passage never describes the process of how the fish bones were discovered.
* **Incorrect (D):** The sentence provides evidence, not a hypothesis. Furthermore, the following sentence confirms and builds upon the information, rather than casting doubt on it.

### Question 8 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Most of the planets that have been discovered outside our solar system orbit G-type stars, like our Sun. ___________, in 2014, researchers identified a planet orbiting KELT-9, a B-type star more than twice as massive and nearly twice as hot as the Sun. Called KELT-9b, it is one of the hottest planets ever discovered.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. likewise,
B. however,
C. therefore,
D. for example,

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "however" correctly introduces information that contrasts with the preceding statement. The first sentence establishes a general rule (most exoplanets orbit G-type stars), and the second sentence introduces an exception (a planet orbiting a B-type star).
* **Incorrect (A):** "likewise" incorrectly suggests a similarity. The discovery of a planet around a B-type star is a contrast to the norm, not a similar case.
* **Incorrect (C):** "therefore" incorrectly implies a cause-and-effect relationship. The discovery of KELT-9b is not a result of most planets orbiting G-type stars.
* **Incorrect (D):** "for example" incorrectly suggests that KELT-9b is an example of the rule. It is an exception to it.

### Question 9 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1837 story "Dr. Heidegger's Experiment." The main character, a physician, is experimenting with rehydrating a dried flower.
At first [the rose] lay lightly on the surface of the fluid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon, however, a singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber.

**Question:**
As used in the text, what does the phrase "a singular" most nearly mean?

**Options:**
A. A lonely
B. A disagreeable
C. An acceptable
D. An extraordinary

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "Singular" in this context means "extraordinary." The transformation of the rose—its color deepening and petals stirring to revive from a "deathlike slumber"—is an exceptional and remarkable event, thus an extraordinary change.
* **Incorrect (A):** While "singular" can refer to a single instance, it does not imply loneliness here, and the text does not describe the rose as lonely.
* **Incorrect (B):** None of the meanings of "singular" relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant, and the text does not portray the change negatively.
* **Incorrect (C):** The change is described as striking and exceptional, not merely "acceptable" or satisfactory.
