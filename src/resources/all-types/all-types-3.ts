**Passage:**
A recent study tracked the number of bee species present in twenty-seven New York apple orchards over a ten-year period. _______ found that when wild growth near an orchard was cleared, the number of different bee species visiting the orchard decreased.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. Entomologist Heather Grab:
B. Entomologist, Heather Grab,
C. Entomologist Heather Grab
D. Entomologist Heather Grab,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The convention being tested is punctuation use between a name and title and between a subject and a verb. No punctuation is needed between the proper noun "Heather Grab" and "entomologist," the title that describes Grab. Additionally, no punctuation is needed between the sentence's subject ("Entomologist Heather Grab") and the main verb ("found") that indicates what Grab did.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Setting the entomologist's name off with commas suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn't the case.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb.

### Question 2 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
The most recent iteration of the immersive theater experience Sleep No More, which premiered in New York City in 2011, transforms its performance space-a five-story warehouse-into a 1930s-era hotel. Audience members, who wander through the labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops, confront the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play's refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges on the sense of spatial fragmentation that the venue's immense and intricate layout generates.

**Question:**
What does the text most strongly suggest about Sleep No More's use of its performance space?

**Options:**
A. The choice of a New York City venue likely enabled the play's creators to experiment with the use of theatrical space in a way that venues from earlier productions could not.
B. Audience members likely find the experience of the play disappointing because they generally cannot make their way through the entire venue.
C. The production's dependence on a particular performance environment would likely make it difficult to reproduce exactly in a different theatrical space.
D. Audience members who navigate the space according to a recommended itinerary will likely have a better grasp of the play's narrative than audience members who depart from that itinerary.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The text says that the production's use of its large, winding space has a very specific effect on the audience. Given that the space itself is so important to creating this effect, it would be difficult to reproduce the production in a different space.
* **Incorrect (A):** The fact that the venue is in New York City isn't connected to the experimental nature of the performance. It's the size of the venue, not its location in New York, that affects the theatrical experience.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text never suggests that audience members are disappointed because they can't see the entire production. In fact, it suggests that that's an important part of the experience.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text doesn't mention a recommended itinerary for audience members.

### Question 3 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Rabinal Achí is a precolonial Maya dance drama performed annually in Rabinal, a town in the Guatemalan highlands. Based on events that occurred when Rabinal was a city-state ruled by a king, ______ had once been an ally of the king but was later captured while leading an invading force against him.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. Rabinal Achí tells the story of K'iche' Achí, a military leader who
B. K'iche' Achí, the military leader in the story of Rabinal Achí,
C. the military leader whose story is told in Rabinal Achí, K'iche' Achí,
D. there was a military leader, K'iche' Achí, who in Rabinal Achí

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The modifier "Based on events...by a king," is describing the drama "Rabinal Achi." Modifiers need to be next to the subjects they describe, so "Rabinal Achí" needs to be the first word after the comma.
* **Incorrect (B):** This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. The modifier "Based on events...by a king," is describing the drama "Rabinal Achí." Modifiers need to be next to the subjects they describe, so "Rabinal Achí" needs to be the first word after the comma.
* **Incorrect (C):** This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. The modifier "Based on events...by a king," is describing the drama "Rabinal Achi." Modifiers need to be next to the subjects they describe, so "Rabinal Achí" needs to be the first word after the comma.
* **Incorrect (D):** This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. The modifier "Based on events...by a king," is describing the drama "Rabinal Achí." Modifiers need to be next to the subjects they describe, so "Rabinal Achí" needs to be the first word after the comma.

### Question 4 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Marta Coll and colleagues' 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri's 2000 census-a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers' decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______________

**Question:**
Which choice most logically completes the text?

**Options:**
A. Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri's census.
B. some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.
C. Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.
D. the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text's discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues' count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri's count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms' morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms' structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers' decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did.
* **Incorrect (A):** Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues' count and Bianchi and Morri's count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri's study.
* **Incorrect (C):** Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species.
* **Incorrect (D):** Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference-it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.

### Question 5 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- As engineered structures, many bird nests are uniquely flexible yet cohesive.
- A research team led by Yashraj Bhosale wanted to better understand the mechanics behind these structural properties.
- Bhosale's team used laboratory models that simulated the arrangement of flexible sticks into nest-like structures.
- The researchers analyzed the points where sticks touched one another.
- When pressure was applied to the model nests, the number of contact points between the sticks increased, making the structures stiffer.

**Question:**
The student wants to present the primary aim of the research study. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

**Options:**
A. Bhosale's team wanted to better understand the mechanics behind bird nests' uniquely flexible yet cohesive structural properties.
B. The researchers used laboratory models that simulated the arrangement of flexible sticks and analyzed the points where sticks touched one another.
C. After analyzing the points where sticks touched, the researchers found that the structures became stiffer when pressure was applied.
D. As analyzed by Bhosale's team, bird nests are uniquely flexible yet cohesive engineered structures.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** It describes the reason Bhosale's team wanted to study the structures of bird nests- that is to say, the study's primary aim.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice doesn't present the primary aim of the research study. It describes how the study worked, but not why it was done.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice doesn't present the primary aim of the research study. It describes a result of the experiment, but not why it was carried out.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice doesn't present the primary aim of the research study.

### Question 6 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
The field of study called affective neuroscience seeks instinctive, physiological causes for feelings such as pleasure or displeasure. Because these sensations are linked to a chemical component (for example, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain when one receives or expects a reward), they can be said to have a partly physiological basis. These processes have been described in mammals, but Jingnan Huang and his colleagues have recently observed that some behaviors of honeybees (such as foraging) are also motivated by a dopamine-based signaling process.

**Question:**
What choice best describes the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. It describes an experimental method of measuring the strength of physiological responses in humans.
B. It illustrates processes by which certain insects can express how they are feeling.
C. It summarizes a finding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains.
D. It presents research showing that certain insects and mammals behave similarly when there is a possibility of a reward for their actions.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** This choice best describes the text's main purpose. The text first explains that feelings in mammals are linked to chemical processes like dopamine release. It then states that researchers have found a similar dopamine-related process in honeybees, suggesting a resemblance in brain mechanisms between these insects and mammals.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text does not describe any specific experimental methods. It only presents observations about mammals and honeybees.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text does not suggest that insects can express their feelings through these processes. While foraging in honeybees is linked to dopamine, this behavior is not presented as a way for them to communicate feelings.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text discusses similar internal mechanisms (dopamine-based signaling) rather than similar behaviors in response to potential rewards.

### Question 7 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
In a heated debate in biogeography, the field is divided between dispersalists and vicariancists. ___________, there are those who argue that dispersal is the most crucial determining factor in a species' distribution, and those who insist that vicariance (separation due to geographic barriers) is. Biogeographer Isabel Sanmartín counts herself among neither.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

**Options:**
A. Furthermore,
B. By contrast,
C. Similarly,
D. That is,

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "That is" correctly signals that the sentence to follow will clarify or explain the terms of the debate mentioned in the first sentence. It defines what "dispersalists" and "vicariancists" believe.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Furthermore" incorrectly suggests that an additional, separate point is being made. The sentence is clarifying the preceding one, not adding to it.
* **Incorrect (B):** "By contrast" incorrectly suggests that the explanation of the two sides contrasts with the statement that there is a debate. The explanation defines the debate.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Similarly" incorrectly suggests the explanation is merely similar to the statement about the debate. It is a direct clarification.

### Question 8 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Rejecting the premise that the literary magazine Ebony and Topaz (1927) should present a unified vision of Black American identity, editor Charles S. Johnson fostered his contributors' diverse perspectives by promoting their authorial autonomy. Johnson's self-effacement diverged from the editorial stances of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke, whose decisions for their publications were more ___________.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. proficient
B. dogmatic
C. ambiguous
D. unpretentious

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** A "dogmatic" person believes their own opinions are true without question. Since Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson (who promoted "diverse perspectives") and are implied to favor a "unified vision," describing their stances as dogmatic is logical.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Proficient" means skilled. The text contrasts editorial styles, not the level of skill between the editors.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Ambiguous" means unclear or having multiple interpretations. Johnson's approach was the one that encouraged multiple interpretations; therefore, the diverging stances of Du Bois and Locke would have been clear and firm, not ambiguous.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Unpretentious" means not trying to impress others. The text provides no information to suggest that Johnson was pretentious, making this an unsupported contrast.

### Question 9 of 9 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
In 1916, H. Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that The Two Noble Kinsmen was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher's contributions to the play were obvious-Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sufficient evidence of Fletcher's authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger.

Text 2
Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare's complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the first act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, both Sykes in Text 1 and the scholars in Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?

**Options:**
A. John Fletcher's writing has a unique, readily identifiable style.
B. The women characters in John Fletcher's plays are similar to the women characters in Philip Massinger's plays.
C. The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in one-volume compilations of Shakespeare's complete plays.
D. Philip Massinger's style in the first and last acts of The Two Noble Kinsmen is an homage to Shakespeare's style.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** Both texts imply that Fletcher's writing has a unique, readily identifiable style that can be used to distinguish his work from others. Text 1 states that Sykes felt Fletcher's contributions to the play were obvious because he had a distinct style. Text 2 states that scholars generally agree "on the basis of style" that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts.
* **Incorrect (B):** Neither text compares the women characters in Fletcher's plays to the women characters in Massinger's plays.
* **Incorrect (C):** Sykes would disagree that the play belongs in a Shakespeare compilation because he disputed that Shakespeare coauthored it.
* **Incorrect (D):** Neither text suggests that Massinger was inspired by Shakespeare or mentions Massinger in Text 2.
