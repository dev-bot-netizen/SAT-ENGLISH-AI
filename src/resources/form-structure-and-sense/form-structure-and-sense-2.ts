**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. developing
B. developed
C. to develop
D. having developed

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice creates a verb form error. The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice creates a verb form error. The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice creates a verb form error. The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."

### Question 2 of 3 ###
**Passage:**
Far from being modern inventions, ______ more than 5,000 years ago.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia used drinking straws
B. drinking straws were used by Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia
C. the use of drinking straws by Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia happened
D. ancient Mesopotamia was home to Sumerians who used drinking straws

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "far from being modern inventions" must be describing "drinking straws," because those are the only possible inventions in this sentence.
* **Incorrect (A):** Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "far from being modern inventions" can't be describing "Sumerians," because they are a group of people, not an invention.
* **Incorrect (C):** Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "far from being modern inventions" can't be describing "the use of drinking straws," because it is not "the use" of drinking straws that is an invention-it is the drinking straws themselves.
* **Incorrect (D):** Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "far from being modern inventions" can't be describing "Ancient Mesopotamia," because that is a place, not an invention.

### Question 3 of 3 ###
**Passage:**
The human brain is primed to recognize faces-so much so that, due to a perceptual tendency called pareidolia, ______ will even find faces in clouds, wooden doors, pieces of fruit, and other faceless inanimate objects. Researcher Susan Magsamen has focused her work on better understanding this everyday phenomenon.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. she
B. they
C. it
D. those

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "It" is a singular pronoun used to stand in for objects. Since the antecedent in this case is the singular noun phrase "the human brain," "it" is a perfect pronoun to use here.
* **Incorrect (A):** Although "she" is a singular pronoun, it is reserved for people and animals, not objects like "the human brain."
* **Incorrect (B):** "They" is a plural pronoun, but we need a singular pronoun to represent the antecedent "the human brain."
* **Incorrect (D):** "Those" is a plural pronoun, but we need a singular pronoun to represent the antecedent "the human brain."
