### Question 4 of 4 ###
**Passage:**

The animal, which lays eggs but also nurses ______ young with milk, has since been classified as belonging to the monotremes group.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. they're
B. their
C. its
D. it's

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The singular possessive pronoun "its" agrees with the singular antecedent "the animal" and indicates that the "young" belong to it.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. "They're" is a contraction of "they are," a plural pronoun and verb, but the antecedent "the animal" is singular. Also, we don't need the extra verb "are" we already have a main verb in this clause, so adding "are" would be confusing and ungrammatical.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. "Their" is a plural pronoun, but the subject of the sentence is "the animal," a singular noun.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. "It's" is a contraction of "it is" or "it has," but the sentence already has a verb and "its" is needed to show possession.
