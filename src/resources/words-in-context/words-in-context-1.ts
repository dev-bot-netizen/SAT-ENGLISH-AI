**Passage:**
The following text is from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. The narrator is being driven in a carriage through a remote region at night.
The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.

**Question:**
As used in the text, what does the word "disturbed" most nearly mean?

**Options:**
A. Disorganized
B. Alarmed
C. Offended
D. Interrupted

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** In this context, "disturbed" means "alarmed." The passage contrasts the narrator and horses, who are "dreadfully afraid," with the driver, who is "not in the least disturbed," showing he was not frightened or alarmed.
* **Incorrect (A):** While "disturbed" can mean disorganized, it doesn't fit the context. The driver continues his task without any sign of disorganization.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Offended" is a possible meaning for "disturbed," but the text is about a fearful situation, not about one character being upset by another's actions.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Interrupted" is another meaning, but the journey continues despite the wolves, so no action is interrupted.

* **Incorrect (A):** There is no suggestion in the text that people would be "nervous about," or worried about, Zollar's creative process.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Completed by" means to be made whole by. It doesn't make logical sense that Zollar's audience would be "completed by" her creative process.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text gives no indication that people would be "delayed by" Zollar's creative process.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
A musician and member of the Quechua of Peru, Renata Flores Rivera was eager to promote the Quechua language in her music, but she was ___________ speaking it. She met this challenge by asking her grandmother, a native speaker of Quechua, to help her pronounce words in her song lyrics and also by taking classes in the language.

**Options:**
A. prepared for
B. inexperienced with
C. skilled in
D. excited about

**Correct Answer:** B

* **Correct (B):** "Inexperienced with" means not being accustomed to something. The text explains that Flores Rivera faced a "challenge" and needed help with pronunciation and took classes, which indicates she was not experienced in speaking Quechua.
* **Incorrect (A):** If she were "prepared for" speaking the language, it wouldn't have been a challenge for her.
* **Incorrect (C):** Being "skilled in" speaking Quechua would mean there was no challenge, which contradicts the text.
* **Incorrect (D):** While she was likely "excited about" using the language, this word does not explain why speaking it was a "challenge" that required help.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is from Yann Martel's 2001 novel Life of Pi. The narrator's family owned a zoo when he was a child.
It was a huge zoo, spread over numberless acres, big enough to require a train to explore it, though it seemed to get smaller as I grew older, train included.

**Question:**
As used in the text, what does the word "spread" most nearly mean?

**Options:**
A. Hidden
B. Discussed
C. Extended
D. Coated

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** In this context, "spread" means "extended." The passage emphasizes the zoo's massive size by describing it as "huge" and covering "numberless acres," which supports the idea that it extended over a large area.
* **Incorrect (A):** A zoo covering "numberless acres" could not be described as "hidden" or concealed.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text focuses on the zoo's physical size, not on whether it was "discussed" or talked about.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Coated" refers to applying a thin layer of something. It does not make sense to say a zoo "coated" the land it was on.

* **Incorrect (A):** "Replacing" the photographs would mean audiences could no longer view the original works.
* **Incorrect (B):** The photographs already exist, so the museum cannot be "inventing" them.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In the 1970s, video cameras became increasingly affordable for ordinary consumers and gave Ulysses Jenkins and other artists capabilities that were previously unavailable except to television broadcasters. Jenkins recognized and took full advantage of this ___________ access to powerful technology to create groundbreaking works of video art, such as Mass of Images (1978).

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. newfound
B. delicate
C. inevitable
D. habitual

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** "Newfound" means recently discovered or established. The text explains that video cameras had only recently become affordable and available to artists like Jenkins, making his access to this technology "newfound."
* **Incorrect (B):** "Delicate," meaning easily broken or fine in texture, does not make sense in the context of access to technology.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Inevitable" means unavoidable, but the text doesn't discuss the likelihood of artists gaining this access, only that it happened.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Habitual" means done regularly. Since the access was recent, it was "newfound," not yet habitual.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
A brief book review cannot fully convey the ___________ of Olga Tokarczuk's novel The Books of Jacob, with its enormous cast of characters, its complicated, wandering plot, and its page numbers that count backward (beginning at 965 and ending at 1).

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. accuracy
B. inactivity
C. complexity
D. restraint

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "Complexity" refers to having many intricate and interconnected parts. The description of the novel—having an "enormous cast," a "complicated, wandering plot," and reverse page numbering—directly points to its complexity.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Accuracy" means being free from error. The features described suggest complexity, not necessarily accuracy.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Inactivity" means a state of doing nothing, which cannot describe a novel itself.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Restraint" means holding back. The novel's features, such as a large cast and complicated plot, suggest the opposite of restraint.
