**Passage:**
Rejecting the premise that the literary magazine Ebony and Topaz (1927) should present a unified vision of Black American identity, editor Charles S. Johnson fostered his contributors' diverse perspectives by promoting their authorial autonomy. Johnson's self-effacement diverged from the editorial stances of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke, whose decisions for their publications were more ___________.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. proficient
B. dogmatic
C. ambiguous
D. unpretentious

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** A "dogmatic" person believes their own opinions are true without question. Since Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson (who promoted "diverse perspectives") and are implied to favor a "unified vision," describing their stances as dogmatic is logical.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Proficient" means skilled. The text contrasts editorial styles, not the level of skill between the editors.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Ambiguous" means unclear or having multiple interpretations. Johnson's approach was the one that encouraged multiple interpretations; therefore, the diverging stances of Du Bois and Locke would have been clear and firm, not ambiguous.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Unpretentious" means not trying to impress others. The text provides no information to suggest that Johnson was pretentious, making this an unsupported contrast.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Economist Marco Castillo and colleagues showed that nuisance costs-the time and effort people must spend to make donations-reduce charitable giving. Charities can mitigate this effect by compensating donors for nuisance costs, but those costs, though variable, are largely ___________ donation size, so charities that compensate donors will likely favor attracting a few large donors over many small donors.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. supplemental to
B. predictive of
C. independent of
D. subsumed in

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "Independent of" means not linked to or influenced by. The text's conclusion is that charities would prefer a few large donors over many small ones if they compensate for nuisance costs. This logic works only if the nuisance cost is roughly the same whether the donation is large or small—meaning the cost is independent of the donation size.
* **Incorrect (A):** If nuisance costs were "supplemental to" (in addition to) the donation size, it wouldn't explain the preference for large donors over small ones.
* **Incorrect (B):** If nuisance costs were "predictive of" the donation size, a clear relationship would exist, which doesn't support the scenario described.
* **Incorrect (D):** If nuisance costs were "subsumed in" (included within) the donation size, it would not lead to the outcome of favoring large donors.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from George Eliot's 1871-72 novel Middlemarch.
[Mr. Brooke] had travelled in his younger years, and was held in this part of the country to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke's conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather.

**Question:**
As used in the text, what does the word "contracted" most nearly mean?

**Options:**
A. Restricted
B. Described
C. Developed
D. Settled

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** In this context, "contracted" means "developed" or acquired. The text likens Mr. Brooke's "rambling habit of mind" to a disease one might contract, suggesting he developed this mental habit over time.
* **Incorrect (A):** While "contracted" can mean restricted, Mr. Brooke's mind is described as "rambling" and unpredictable, the opposite of restricted.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text is describing Mr. Brooke's habit of mind, but there is no suggestion that he himself "described" it.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Settled" means calmed or mitigated. Mr. Brooke's mind is unpredictable, not settled.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The güiro, a musical instrument traditionally made from a dried and hollowed gourd, is thought to have originated with the Taíno people of Puerto Rico. Players use a wooden stick to scrape along ridges cut into the side of the gourd, creating sounds that are highly ___________: the sounds produced by güiros can differ based on the distance between the ridges, the types of strokes the player uses, and the thickness of the gourd.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. overlooked
B. powerful
C. routine
D. variable

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "Variable" means able to change or be changed. The text explicitly states that the sounds from a güiro can "differ based on" several factors (ridge distance, stroke type, gourd thickness), which directly supports the idea that the sounds are variable.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Overlooked" means not noticed. There is nothing in the passage to suggest the sounds are ignored.
* **Incorrect (B):** While the sounds might be "powerful" in effect, the text focuses on how the sounds can change, not their impact on listeners.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Routine" means unvarying, which is the opposite of what the text describes. The passage highlights how the sounds can differ.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
While scholars believe many Mesoamerican cities influenced each other, direct evidence of such influence is difficult to ascertain. However, recent excavations in a sector of Tikal (Guatemala) unearthed a citadel that shows ___________ Teotihuacán (Mexico) architecture-including a near replica of a famed Teotihuacán temple-providing tangible evidence of outside influence in portions of Tikal.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. refinements of
B. precursors of
C. commonalities with
D. animosities toward

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** "Commonalities with" means shared attributes or similarities with. The text describes a citadel in Tikal that has a "near replica" of a temple from Teotihuacán, which is clear evidence of shared architectural features, or commonalities.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Refinements of" suggests improvements upon. The text notes imitation but does not state whether the Tikal citadel improved upon Teotihuacán's architecture.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Precursors of" would mean Tikal's architecture came before and foreshadowed Teotihuacán's. The text argues for the opposite direction of influence, from Teotihuacán to Tikal.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Animosities toward" means strong dislike. Replicating another city's architecture suggests admiration, not hostility.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Close analysis of the painting Girl with a Flute, long attributed to the seventeenth-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, has revealed subtle deviations from the artist's signature techniques. These variations suggest that the work may be that of a student under Vermeer's tutelage-potentially ___________ our understanding of Vermeer as a solitary artist.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. negating
B. prefiguring
C. entrenching
D. substantiating

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** "Negating" means to invalidate or make null. The discovery that Vermeer may have had students would invalidate, or negate, the previous understanding of him as a "solitary artist."
* **Incorrect (B):** "Prefiguring" means to be an early sign of. The view of Vermeer as solitary already existed, so new evidence contradicting it cannot be a "prefiguring" of that view.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Entrenching" means to solidify or establish firmly. Evidence of students would contradict, not entrench, the idea of him being solitary.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Substantiating" means to provide proof for. The new finding would disprove, not substantiate, the view of him as a solitary artist.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
While most animals are incapable of passing somatic mutations-genetic alterations that arise in an organism's nonreproductive cells-on to their offspring, elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) presents an intriguing ___________: in a 2022 study, researchers found that elkhorn coral produced offspring that inherited somatic mutations from a parent.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. hypothesis
B. affinity
C. anomaly
D. corroboration

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** An "anomaly" is something that deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected. Since most animals cannot pass on somatic mutations, the elkhorn coral's ability to do so makes it a deviation from the norm, or an anomaly.
* **Incorrect (A):** A "hypothesis" is a proposed explanation or theory. The text presents a factual finding about elkhorn coral, not a theory.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Affinity" means a liking or inclination. Genetic mutations are a biological process, not something an organism has an inclination toward.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Corroboration" is evidence that confirms or supports a statement. The elkhorn coral's behavior contradicts the general rule, so it is not a corroboration of it.
