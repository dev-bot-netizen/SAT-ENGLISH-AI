**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1837 story "Dr. Heidegger's Experiment." The main character, a physician, is experimenting with rehydrating a dried flower.
At first [the rose] lay lightly on the surface of the fluid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon, however, a singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber.

**Question:**
As used in the text, what does the phrase "a singular" most nearly mean?

**Options:**
A. A lonely
B. A disagreeable
C. An acceptable
D. An extraordinary

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "Singular" in this context means "extraordinary." The transformation of the rose—its color deepening and petals stirring to revive from a "deathlike slumber"—is an exceptional and remarkable event, thus an extraordinary change.
* **Incorrect (A):** While "singular" can refer to a single instance, it does not imply loneliness here, and the text does not describe the rose as lonely.
* **Incorrect (B):** None of the meanings of "singular" relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant, and the text does not portray the change negatively.
* **Incorrect (C):** The change is described as striking and exceptional, not merely "acceptable" or satisfactory.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The work of molecular biophysicist Enrique M. De La Cruz is known for ___________ traditional boundaries between academic disciplines. The university laboratory that De La Cruz runs includes engineers, biologists, chemists, and physicists, and the research the lab produces makes use of insights and techniques from all those fields.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. epitomizing
B. transcending
C. anticipating
D. reinforcing

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "Transcending" means going beyond limits. De La Cruz's lab combines multiple disciplines (engineering, biology, chemistry, physics), so his work goes beyond, or transcends, the traditional boundaries of a single field.
* **Incorrect (A):** To "epitomize" means to be a perfect example of something. Epitomizing traditional boundaries would mean keeping the fields separate, the opposite of what the text describes.
* **Incorrect (C):** "Anticipating," or expecting, traditional boundaries does not fit the context of actively combining different fields.
* **Incorrect (D):** "Reinforcing" traditional boundaries would mean strengthening the separation between fields, which is the opposite of De La Cruz's multidisciplinary approach.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is from F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby.
[Jay Gatsby] was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American-that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness.

**Question:**
As used in the text, what does the word "quality" most nearly mean?

**Options:**
A. Standard
B. Prestige
C. Characteristic
D. Accomplishment

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** In this context, "quality" refers to a "characteristic" or trait. The passage describes Gatsby's "resourcefulness of movement" as "this quality," identifying it as a personal trait.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Standard" refers to a level of excellence, which is a different meaning of "quality" not intended here.
* **Incorrect (B):** "Prestige" implies high status or reputation, which doesn't fit the description of a type of movement.
* **Incorrect (D):** An "accomplishment" is an achievement, whereas the text is describing an inherent trait, not something achieved.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
To develop a method for measuring snow depth with laser beams, NASA physicist Yongxiang Hu relied on ___________: identifying broad similarities between two seemingly different phenomena, Hu used information about how ants move inside colonies to calculate how the particles of light that make up laser beams travel through snow.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. a collaboration
B. an accessory
C. a contradiction
D. an analogy

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** An "analogy" is a comparison between two different things to explain a principle or idea. Hu's method of comparing the movement of ants to the travel of light particles is a perfect example of using an analogy.
* **Incorrect (A):** "Collaboration" means working with others. The text describes a comparison of ideas, not Hu working with other researchers.
* **Incorrect (B):** An "accessory" is something added for usefulness or attractiveness. No such item is described in the text.
* **Incorrect (C):** A "contradiction" involves opposing ideas. Hu's method relies on the similarities between ant and light particle movement, not their differences.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
A journalist and well-respected art critic of nineteenth-century Britain, Lady Elizabeth Rigby Eastlake did not hesitate to publish reviews that went against popular opinion. One of her most divisive works was an essay questioning the idea of photography as an emerging medium for fine art: in the essay, Eastlake ___________ that the value of photographs was informational rather than creative.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. exposed
B. asserted
C. discovered
D. doubted

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "Asserted" means to state something confidently. Since Eastlake was known for publishing reviews that "went against popular opinion," it is logical that she would confidently state, or assert, her controversial views on photography.
* **Incorrect (A):** To "expose" something suggests uncovering a hidden truth. Eastlake was sharing her opinion, not revealing a factual truth.
* **Incorrect (C):** To "discover" something implies finding a new, universal truth. Eastlake was presenting her own opinion in an essay.
* **Incorrect (D):** To say Eastlake "doubted" that photographs were informational would be the opposite of her stated position, which questioned their value as creative art.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Stephen Hannock's luminous landscape paintings are appealing to viewers but have elicited little commentary from contemporary critics, a phenomenon that may be due to the very fact that the paintings seem so ___________: Many critics focus their attention on art that is cryptic or overtly challenging.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. innovative
B. subversive
C. profound
D. accessible

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "Accessible" in this context means easy to understand. This creates a logical contrast with the art that critics prefer, which is described as "cryptic or challenging" (i.e., not easy to understand).
* **Incorrect (A):** If the paintings were "innovative" (advanced and original), critics would likely comment on them, which contradicts the premise of the text.
* **Incorrect (B):** If the paintings were "subversive" (disruptive), critics would probably take notice, which they are said not to do.
* **Incorrect (C):** If the paintings were "profound" (deep and insightful), they would likely attract critical commentary, contrary to what the text states.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In 2008 a complete set of ancient pessoi (glass game pieces) was uncovered from beneath a paving stone in modern-day Israel. Due to their small size, pessoi were easily misplaced, making a whole set a rare find. This has led some experts to suggest that the set may have been buried intentionally; however, without clear evidence, archaeologists are left to ___________ what happened.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

**Options:**
A. speculate about
B. dismiss
C. expand on
D. catalog

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** "To speculate" means to form a theory without clear evidence. Since the archaeologists lack "clear evidence," they can only guess, or speculate, about what happened to the game pieces.
* **Incorrect (B):** To "dismiss" something means to treat it as unworthy of consideration. The archaeologists are trying to understand what happened, not ignore it.
* **Incorrect (C):** To "expand on" something means to give more detail. Without clear evidence, the archaeologists have no details to add.
* **Incorrect (D):** To "catalog" means to record information systematically. With no clear evidence, there is no information for them to catalog.
