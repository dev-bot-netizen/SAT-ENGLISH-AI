**Passage:**
Photosynthesis, the mechanism by which plants use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into ________ is fueled in part by an enzyme called Photosystem II that harvests energy-giving electrons from water molecules.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. nutrients
B. nutrients and
C. nutrients,
D. nutrients-

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary element within a sentence. The comma after "nutrients" pairs with the comma after "photosynthesis" to separate the supplementary element "the mechanism by which plants use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into nutrients" from the rest of the sentence. This supplementary element defines "photosynthesis," and the pair of commas indicates that it could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.
* **Incorrect (B):** A conjunction can't be paired with a comma in this way to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.
* **Incorrect (D):** A dash can't be paired with a comma in this way to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.

* **Incorrect (B):** When coordinating two longer main clauses, it's conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses.

### Question 4 of 7 ###

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. CE making
B. CE. Making
C. CE, making
D. CE; making

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The phrase "making...at the time" provides additional information about Cahokia that is not required for the sentence to make sense or function grammatically. As a nonessential supplement, this phrase should be separated from the rest of the sentence with a comma.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice results in a run-on sentence. The nonessential descriptive aside "making...at the time" needs to be separated from the rest of the sentence with a comma.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice results in a sentence fragment. "Making...at the time" doesn't have a subject and can't stand on its own as a sentence, so it can't be separated from the rest of the sentence with a period.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice results in a punctuation error. "Making...at the time" doesn't have a subject and can't stand on its own as an independent clause. Since a semicolon can only link two independent clauses, using one here creates an error.
