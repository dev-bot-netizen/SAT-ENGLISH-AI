A recent study tracked the number of bee species present in twenty-seven New York apple orchards over a ten-year period. ______ found that when wild growth near an orchard was cleared, the number of different bee species visiting the orchard decreased.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. Entomologist Heather Grab:
B. Entomologist, Heather Grab,
C. Entomologist Heather Grab
D. Entomologist Heather Grab,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The convention being tested is punctuation use between a name and title and between a subject and a verb. No punctuation is needed between the proper noun "Heather Grab" and "entomologist," the title that describes Grab. Additionally, no punctuation is needed between the sentence's subject ("Entomologist Heather Grab") and the main verb ("found") that indicates what Grab did.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Setting the entomologist's name off with commas suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn't the case.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In a 2016 study, Eastern Washington University psychologist Amani El-Alayli found that, among the study participants who experienced frisson (a physiological response akin to goosebumps or getting the chills) while listening to music, there was one personality trait that they scored particularly ______ openness to experience.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. high. On
B. high on;
C. high on
D. high on:

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a supplementary phrase. A colon is correctly used to mark the boundary between the main clause ("there...on") and the supplementary phrase ("openness to experience") and to introduce the information that identifies which personality trait participants scored especially high on.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with "on" and separates a necessary preposition from the clause beginning with "there".
* **Incorrect (B):** A semicolon can't be used in this way to join the main clause and the supplementary phrase. A semicolon is conventionally used to join two main clauses, whereas a colon is conventionally used to introduce an element that explains or amplifies the information in the preceding clause, making the colon the better choice in this context.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice fails to mark the boundary between the main clause and the supplementary phrase.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In 2018, a team of researchers led by Dr. Caitlin Whalen compiled every available measurement of ocean mixing rates from the past two decades. With this novel data set, the team was able to determine how current-driven mixing varies across ______ and what impact it has on the distribution of heat and nutrients in the ocean.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. regions,
B. regions:
C. regions;
D. regions

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The convention being tested is punctuation between coordinates in a sentence. The two elements "how...regions" and "what...ocean" work together as coordinates to complete the description of what the team was able to determine. Because there are only two coordinates, no punctuation is needed between them.
* **Incorrect (A):** No punctuation is needed between the coordinates "how...regions" and "what...ocean".
* **Incorrect (B):** No punctuation is needed between the coordinates "how...regions" and "what...ocean".
* **Incorrect (C):** No punctuation is needed between the coordinates "how...regions" and "what...ocean".

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Researcher Lin Zhi developed a process for increasing the tensile strength—measured in gigapascals, or GPa—of silkworm ______ dissolving and reweaving the silk in a solution of iron metal ions, zinc, and sugar, Zhi increased the amount of force required to stretch it from approximately 0.5 GPa to 2 GPa.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. silk, by
B. silk by
C. silk and by
D. silk. By

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The independent clauses "researcher Lin Zhi...silk" and "by dissolving...2 GPa" can be grammatically separated by a period. They can stand alone as sentences, and this is the only choice that lets them do that.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice results in a comma splice because two independent clauses are incorrectly joined with a comma alone.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice results in a run-on sentence. Two independent clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice results in a run-on sentence because the coordinating conjunction "and" is not enough to link two independent clauses without a preceding comma.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In discussing Mary Shelley's 1818 epistolary novel Frankenstein, literary theorist Gayatri Spivak directs the reader's attention to the character of Margaret Saville. As Spivak points out, Saville is not the protagonist of Shelley's ______ as the recipient of the letters that frame the book's narrative, she's the "occasion" of it.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. novel
B. novel,
C. novel; rather,
D. novel, rather,

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a semicolon to join a main clause ("Saville...novel") and a second main clause ("she's...it") that is preceded by supplementary elements ("rather...narrative").
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can't be used to join two main clauses.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, the comma after "novel" can't be used to join the two main clauses.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Using satellite remote sensing, Dr. Catherine Nakalembe, director of NASA's Harvest Africa initiative, gathers important data on crop health. Nakalembe doesn't just compile the ______ she also shares her findings with African farmers, enabling them to make data-driven decisions about managing critical food crops.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. information, though;
B. information, though,
C. information; though
D. information though,

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This choice uses a semicolon to join two independent clauses ("Nakalembe doesn't just...though" and "she also shares..."). This choice also appropriately includes "though" in the first clause, where it logically belongs.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice results in a comma splice, incorrectly joining two independent clauses with only a comma.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice results in a punctuation error. A semicolon can only be used to link two independent clauses. If "though" is included in the second clause, it turns the second clause into a dependent clause, so a semicolon can't be used after "information".
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice results in a comma splice, incorrectly joining two independent clauses with only a comma.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In paleontology, the term "Elvis taxon" gets applied to a newly identified living species that was once presumed to be extinct. Like an Elvis impersonator who might bear a striking resemblance to the late musical icon Elvis Presley himself, an Elvis taxon is not the real thing, ______ it is a misidentified look-alike.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. however but it
B. however it
C. however, it
D. however. It

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The clause "Like an Elvis impersonator...real thing" and the clause "it is...look-alike" are both independent clauses, so making them into two separate sentences is grammatically correct.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The two independent clauses need to be separated with at least a comma + a coordinating conjunction. This choice provides the coordinating conjunction "but," but it is missing a comma.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice creates a run-on sentence error because the two independent clauses are not separated with appropriate punctuation.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The two independent clauses need to be separated with at least a comma + a coordinating conjunction, but this choice is missing the coordinating conjunction.
