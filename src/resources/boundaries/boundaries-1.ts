**Passage:**
While one requires oxygen and one does ______ and anaerobic respiration are both forms of cellular respirationâ€”that is, they are processes by which cells break down glucose to use as energy.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. not aerobic
B. not. Aerobic
C. not, aerobic
D. not; aerobic

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** A comma is the appropriate way to link the dependent clause "While...not" and the independent clause that follows.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice creates a run-on sentence error. "While...not" is a dependent clause, which must be separated from the independent clause that follows with some sort of punctuation.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice creates a sentence fragment. "While one requires oxygen and one does not" isn't an independent clause, so it can't stand alone as a complete sentence.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice creates a punctuation error. "While one requires oxygen and one does not" isn't an independent clause, so it can't be linked to the clause that follows with a semicolon.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Human-made (synthetic) fibers used in clothes and many other consumer products are more durable than most natural plant ______ the manufacture of synthetic fibers requires toxic chemical solvents that can pollute air and water.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. fibers,
B. fibers but
C. fibers
D. fibers, but

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction "but" to join the first main clause ("Human-made...fibers") and the second main clause ("the manufacture...water").
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses.
* **Incorrect (B):** When coordinating two longer main clauses, it's conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Emperor Ashoka ruled the Maurya Empire in South Asia from roughly 270 to 232 BCE. He is known for enforcing a moral code called the Law of Piety, which established the sanctity of animal ______ the just treatment of the elderly, and the abolition of the slave trade.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. life
B. life;
C. life:
D. life,

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** "The sanctity of animal life" is the first item in a list of three things. A comma is required to separate the first two items in the list, just as a comma is used to separate "the just treatment of the elderly" and "the abolition of the slave trade".
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice creates a punctuation error. To appropriately format the list, punctuation is needed to separate each item.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice creates a punctuation error. While semicolons are sometimes used to separate list items, this list uses commas for the other items, and lists must use the same punctuation throughout.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice creates a punctuation error. While colons can be used to introduce lists, they can't be used to separate items within a list.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
A subseasonal weather forecast attempts to predict weather conditions three to four weeks in ______ its predictions are therefore more short-term than those of the seasonal forecast, which attempts to predict the weather more than a month in advance.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. advance,
B. advance
C. advance;
D. advance and

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The clauses "A subseasonal...advance" and "its predictions...forecast" are both independent clauses, so using a semicolon to separate them is grammatically correct.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The two independent clauses cannot be separated by only a comma.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The two independent clauses need to be separated with specific punctuation (a period, a semicolon, a colon, a dash, or a comma + a coordinating conjunction).
* **Incorrect (D):** The word "and" by itself is not enough to separate the two independent clauses. There would need to be a comma before "and" for this choice to work.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In her book The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts, author Maxine Hong Kingston examines themes ______ childhood, womanhood, and Chinese American identity by intertwining autobiography and mythology.

**Question:**
Which choice completes thetext so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. of:
B. of
C. of-
D. of,

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** "Themes of childhood" is one noun phrase, with "themes of" implicitly carrying over to the other items on the list ("themes of childhood, [themes of] womanhood, and [themes of] Chinese American identity"). No punctuation is needed after "of".
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. Also, "In her book...themes of" is not an independent clause, so it can't precede a colon.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. Also, "In her book...themes of" is not an independent clause, so it can't precede a single dash.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. "Themes of" implicitly carries over to each item, so a comma is not needed to separate it.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Because regolith is both readily available and high in oxygen ______ scientists have wondered whether it could be used as a potential source of oxygen for future lunar settlements.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. content and
B. content,
C. content
D. content, and

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The convention being tested is punctuation between a subordinate clause and a main clause. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause ("Because...content") and the main clause ("scientists...settlements").
* **Incorrect (A):** Joining the subordinate clause and the following clause with the conjunction "and" results in an ungrammatical sentence that lacks a main clause.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice fails to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause and the main clause with appropriate punctuation.
* **Incorrect (D):** Joining the subordinate clause and the following clause with a comma and the conjunction "and" results in an ungrammatical sentence that lacks a main clause.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Psychophysicist Howard Moskowitz was hired by a soda company to determine how much artificial sweetener ______ After conducting consumer taste tests, he found that no such ideal existed: participants expressed a wide range of preferences for different blends of sweetener, carbonization, and flavoring.

**Question:**
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

**Options:**
A. do most people prefer in a diet drink?
B. do most people prefer in a diet drink.
C. most people prefer in a diet drink?
D. most people prefer in a diet drink.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** This sentence is a statement: "Moskowitz was hired by a soda company to determine how much artificial sweetener most people prefer in a diet drink". So a period is the most appropriate punctuation mark.
* **Incorrect (A):** This is not a question, so a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation.
* **Incorrect (B):** The verb "do" is not needed and results in a confusing, ungrammatical sentence.
* **Incorrect (C):** This is not a question, so a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation.
