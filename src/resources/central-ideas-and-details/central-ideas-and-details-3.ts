**Passage:**
The most recent iteration of the immersive theater experience Sleep No More, which premiered in New York City in 2011, transforms its performance space-a five-story warehouse-into a 1930s-era hotel. Audience members, who wander through the labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops, confront the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play's refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges on the sense of spatial fragmentation that the venue's immense and intricate layout generates.

**Question:**
What does the text most strongly suggest about Sleep No More's use of its performance space?

**Options:**
A. The choice of a New York City venue likely enabled the play's creators to experiment with the use of theatrical space in a way that venues from earlier productions could not.
B. Audience members likely find the experience of the play disappointing because they generally cannot make their way through the entire venue.
C. The production's dependence on a particular performance environment would likely make it difficult to reproduce exactly in a different theatrical space.
D. Audience members who navigate the space according to a recommended itinerary will likely have a better grasp of the play's narrative than audience members who depart from that itinerary.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The text says that the production's use of its large, winding space has a very specific effect on the audience. Given that the space itself is so important to creating this effect, it would be difficult to reproduce the production in a different space.
* **Incorrect (A):** The fact that the venue is in New York City isn't connected to the experimental nature of the performance. It's the size of the venue, not its location in New York, that affects the theatrical experience.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text never suggests that audience members are disappointed because they can't see the entire production. In fact, it suggests that that's an important part of the experience.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text doesn't mention a recommended itinerary for audience members.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from María Cristina Mena's 1914 short story "The Vine-Leaf". It is a saying in the capital of Mexico that Dr. Malsufrido carries more family secrets under his hat than any archbishop. The doctor's hat is, appropriately enough, uncommonly capacious, rising very high, and sinking so low that it seems to be supported by his ears and eyebrows, and it has a furry look, as if it had been brushed the wrong way, which is perhaps what happens to it if it is ever brushed at all. When the doctor takes it off, the family secrets do not fly out like a flock of parrots, but remain nicely bottled up beneath a dome of old and highly polished ivory.

**Question:**
Based on the text, how do people in the capital of Mexico most likely regard Dr. Malsufrido?

**Options:**
A. Many have come to tolerate him despite his disheveled appearance.
B. Few feel concerned that he will divulge their confidences.
C. Some dislike how freely he discusses his own family.
D. Most would be unimpressed by him were it not for his professional expertise.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The text describes a saying in the capital that Malsufrido keeps more secrets than an archbishop. It also says that when he takes off his hat, "the family secrets do not fly out... but remain nicely bottled up," suggesting that he will not betray his confidences.
* **Incorrect (A):** While his hat is large and appears to have been brushed in the wrong direction, Dr. Malsufrido does not seem to be regarded as ill-dressed or disheveled.
* **Incorrect (C):** This choice is the opposite of what the text says. The secrets of families (his and others') remain "bottled up" in his head.
* **Incorrect (D):** His professional expertise is not discussed in the passage.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Countee Cullen's 1926 poem "Thoughts in a Zoo". They in their cruel traps, and we in ours, Survey each other's rage, and pass the hours Commiserating each the other's woe, To mitigate his own pain's fiery glow. Man could but little proffer in exchange Save that his cages have a larger range. That lion with his lordly, untamed heart Has in some man his human counterpart, Some lofty soul in dreams and visions wrapped, But in the stifling flesh securely trapped.

**Question:**
Based on the text, what challenge do humans sometimes experience?

**Options:**
A. They cannot effectively tame certain wild animals because of a lack of compassion.
B. They cannot focus on setting attainable goals because of a lack of motivation.
C. They quickly become frustrated when faced with difficult tasks because of a lack of self-control.
D. They have aspirations that cannot be fulfilled because of certain limitations.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The text metaphorically likens humans to animals in a zoo, suggesting that humans have dreams that they cannot fulfill because they are trapped.
* **Incorrect (A):** The speaker says that the lion has an "untamed heart," but the speaker doesn't actually mention anything about humans taming wild animals or a lack of compassion.
* **Incorrect (B):** The speaker doesn't suggest that humans lack motivation. Rather, the speaker thinks that humans are "trapped" and prevented from achieving their dreams.
* **Incorrect (C):** The speaker doesn't mention anything about humans becoming frustrated or lacking self-control. Rather, the speaker thinks that humans are "trapped" and prevented from achieving their dreams.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
For centuries, the widespread acknowledgment of the involvement of the cerebellum-a dense brain structure in vertebrates-in coordinating motor control in humans has hindered recognition of other possible functions of the structure. Neuroscience research from the last two decades now suggests that the cerebellum regulates emotion and social behavior, and recent research by Ilaria Carta and colleagues has identified a pathway connecting the cerebellum to a center for motivation and reward processing known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA).

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

**Options:**
A. The recent verification of a pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum confirms the cerebellum's long-suspected role in motor coordination.
B. Recent advances in the field of neuroscience have challenged widely accepted claims about the function of a pathway connecting the VTA and the cerebellum.
C. The cerebellum has primarily been thought to regulate motor functioning, but in recent years neuroscience researchers have been uncovering additional functions.
D. Technological limitations have historically hindered the study of the cerebellum, but the recent development of new technologies has led to greater insights into its functions.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The text says that the cerebellum has long been thought to regulate motor functioning, but new research shows that it may also have other functions-including regulating emotion and social behavior and some connection to motivation and rewards processing.
* **Incorrect (A):** The VTA is described as "a center for motivation and reward processing," and the discovery of the pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum supports the theory that the cerebellum is involved in functions other than motor coordination.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text says that recent research has identified this pathway, but it doesn't discuss any previous "widely accepted claims" about the pathway's function. The "widespread acknowledgement" mentioned early in the passage is about the cerebellum alone, not its connection to the VTA.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text never discusses any technological limitations or any new technologies.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Algae living within the tissues of corals play a critical role in keeping corals, and the marine ecosystems they are part of, thriving. Some coral species appear brown in color when healthy due to the algae colonies living in their tissues. In the event of an environmental stressor, the algae can die or be expelled, causing the corals to appear white. To recover the algae, the bleached corals then begin to produce bright colors, which block intense sunlight, encouraging the light-sensitive algae to recolonize the corals.

**Question:**
What does the text most strongly suggest about corals that produce bright colors?

**Options:**
A. These corals have likely been subjected to stressful environmental conditions.
B. These corals are likely more vulnerable to exposure from intense sunlight than white corals are.
C. These corals have likely recovered from an environmental event without the assistance of algae colonies.
D. These corals are more likely to survive without algae colonies than brown corals are.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The text says that corals produce bright colors to block sunlight and encourage algae to recolonize after "an environmental stressor". From this, we can infer that corals that produce bright colors have probably been subjected to an environmental stressor.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text says that corals produce bright colors to block intense sunlight, which protects the light-sensitive algae that keep the coral healthy. In other words, bright colors make the coral's health less vulnerable to intense sunlight.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text says that corals produce bright colors to encourage algae to recolonize, not that they have recovered without the assistance of algae colonies.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text never compares the likelihood of differently colored corals surviving without algae colonies.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Having written the impassioned call to arms "Letter to the Spanish Americans" in 1791, Peruvian intellectual Juan Pablo Viscardo y Guzmán is often considered a forerunner for the independence movements in Latin America. But Viscardo's role in history would have remained insignificant were it not for Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda, who was handed the unpublished letter after Viscardo's death. Miranda not only helped circulate the letter, but his edits and footnotes to the text position Miranda as a central figure in the text's creation.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

**Options:**
A. The original authorship of "Letter to the Spanish Americans" is disputed by contemporary historians.
B. The majority of the most eloquently stated arguments in "Letter to the Spanish Americans" were written by Miranda.
C. Miranda played a crucial role in influencing the content and distribution of "Letter to the Spanish Americans."
D. "Letter to the Spanish Americans" persuaded many people in Latin America to pursue national independence.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The text describes how Miranda circulated, edited, and added footnotes to "Letter to the Spanish Americans," and it claims that the letter and its author would have "remained insignificant" if it weren't for Miranda's efforts.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text only says that Viscardo wrote the letter and that Miranda edited it: it never suggests that the original authorship of the letter is up for debate.
* **Incorrect (B):** This contradicts the text. The text says that Miranda edited and footnoted the letter, but it identifies Viscardo as the letter's author. It also never identifies certain arguments as more eloquent than others.
* **Incorrect (D):** This is outside the scope of the text. The paragraph describes Miranda's role in the creation and distribution of the letter, but it doesn't get into the effects of the letter on other people.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. describe a method for fabricating the cell's electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale-an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as "highly reproducible, concise, and practical".

**Question:**
What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?

**Options:**
A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.
B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.
C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.
D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** Conventional solar cell fabrication increases "the cost of manufacturing at scale," but spray coating might get rid of that problem.
* **Incorrect (B):** While it's true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there's nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures.
* **Incorrect (C):** Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can't compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication.
