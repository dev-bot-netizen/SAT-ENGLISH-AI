**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Johanna Spyri's 1881 novel Heidi (translated by Elisabeth Stork in 1915). Eight- year-old Heidi and her friend's grandmother are looking at some illustrated books. Heidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books, that Grandmama was showing her. Suddenly she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful flock grazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing, leaning on his crook. The setting sun was shedding a golden light over everything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

**Options:**
A. Heidi is upset until she sees a serene image of a pasture in one of Grandmama's books.
B. Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama's books.
C. Heidi is initially frightened by an image in one of Grandmama's books but quickly comes to appreciate its beauty.
D. Heidi is inspecting an image in one of Grandmama's books because she has never seen a shepherd with his sheep before.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** This is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama's books. The text describes Heidi's eyes as "glowing" and says she "devoured the scene," suggesting she is thrilled and intrigued by the image. Her scream is followed by descriptions of a peaceful scene, suggesting it was a scream of delight, not fear.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text does not suggest Heidi was upset before seeing the image. She is described as "looking with wondering eyes," which suggests she was intrigued, not unhappy.
* **Incorrect (C):** Although Heidi screams, the description of the peaceful image and her "glowing eyes" suggests she screamed with delight, not fear.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text doesn't clarify whether Heidi has seen a shepherd before. It only suggests her delight and fascination with the image.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Artist Justin Favela explained that he wanted to reclaim the importance of the piñata as a symbol in Latinx culture. To do so, he created numerous sculptures from strips of tissue paper, which is similar to the material used to create piñatas. In 2017, Favela created an impressive life-size piñata-like sculpture of the Gypsy Rose lowrider car, which was displayed at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, California. The Gypsy Rose lowrider was famously driven by Jesse Valadez, an early president of the Los Angeles Imperials Car Club.

**Question:**
According to the text, which piece of Favela's art was on display in the Petersen Automotive Museum in 2017?

**Options:**
A. A painting of Los Angeles
B. A sculpture of a lowrider car
C. A painting of a piñata
D. A sculpture of Jesse Valadez

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The text explicitly states that Favela created a "life-size piñata-like sculpture of the Gypsy Rose lowrider car" which was displayed at the museum.
* **Incorrect (A):** The artwork was a sculpture, not a painting, and it depicted a car, not Los Angeles.
* **Incorrect (C):** The artwork was a sculpture, not a painting, and it depicted a car.
* **Incorrect (D):** Jesse Valadez drove the car that was the subject of the sculpture; the sculpture was not of him.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In 2022, researchers rediscovered ancient indigenous glyphs, or drawings, on the walls of a cave in Alabama. The cave's ceiling was only a few feet high, affording no position from which the glyphs, being as wide as ten feet, could be viewed or photographed in their entirety. However, the researchers used a technique called photogrammetry to assemble numerous photos of the walls into a 3D model. They then worked with representatives of tribes originally from the region, including the Chickasaw Nation, to understand the significance of the animal and humanoid figures adorning the cave.

**Question:**
According to the text, what challenge did the researchers have to overcome to examine the glyphs?

**Options:**
A. The cave was so remote that the researchers couldn't easily reach it.
B. Some of the glyphs were so faint that they couldn't be photographed.
C. The researchers were unable to create a 3D model of the cave.
D. The cave's dimensions prevented the researchers from fully viewing the glyphs.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The text states that the cave's ceiling was only a few feet high, which made it impossible to view or photograph the wide glyphs in their entirety.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text does not mention the cave's location or suggest it was difficult to access.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text does not say the glyphs were faint; it says they were too wide to be photographed completely.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text states the opposite; the researchers were able to create a 3D model using photogrammetry.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
NASA's Cassini probe has detected an unusual wobble in the rotation of Mimas, Saturn's smallest moon. Using a computer model to study Mimas's gravitational interactions with Saturn and tidal forces, geophysicist Alyssa Rhoden and colleagues have proposed that this wobble could be due to a liquid ocean moving beneath the moon's icy surface. The researchers believe other moons should be examined to see if they too might have oceans hidden beneath their surfaces.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

**Options:**
A. Rhoden and colleagues were the first to confirm that several of Saturn's moons contain hidden oceans.
B. Research has failed to identify signs that there is an ocean hidden beneath the surface of Mimas.
C. Rhoden and colleagues created a new computer model that identifies moons with hidden oceans without needing to analyze the moons' rotation.
D. Research has revealed that an oddity in the rotation of Mimas could be explained by an ocean hidden beneath its surface.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The text explains that an "unusual wobble in the rotation of Mimas" was detected, and researchers have "proposed that this wobble could be due to a liquid ocean moving beneath the moon's icy surface".
* **Incorrect (A):** The research is a proposal, not a confirmation, and it only applies to Mimas, with a suggestion to examine other moons.
* **Incorrect (B):** This is the opposite of what the text says. Research did find a sign—the wobble—that might be caused by a hidden ocean.
* **Incorrect (C):** The computer model did study the rotation of Mimas (via gravitational interactions), so this choice is incorrect.
