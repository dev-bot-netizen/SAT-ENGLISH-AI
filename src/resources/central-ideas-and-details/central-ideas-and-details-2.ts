**Passage:**
A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the painted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography's impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of both full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.

**Question:**
Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth century?

**Options:**
A. Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature's decline.
B. Although portrait miniatures became less common than photographs, they were widely regarded as having more artistic merit.
C. The popularity of the portrait miniature likely persisted for longer than art historians have assumed.
D. As demand for portrait miniatures decreased, portrait artists likely shifted their creative focus to photography.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be "overstated," as some records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. From this, we can conclude that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature's decline.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text never discusses the "artistic merit" of either art form.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text never suggests that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought-if anything, it suggests that the portrait miniature started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text never suggests that portrait painters shifted to become photographers.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Biologists have predicted that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature, but this hadn't been tested in mountain environments. Ornithologist Sahas Barve studied feathers from 249 songbird species inhabiting different elevations-and thus experiencing different temperatures-in the Himalaya Mountains. He found that feathers of high-elevation species not only have a greater proportion of warming downy sections to flat and smooth sections than do feathers of low-elevation species, but high-elevation species' feathers also tend to be longer, providing a thicker layer of insulation.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

**Options:**
A. Barve's investigation shows that some species of Himalayan songbirds have evolved feathers that better regulate body temperature than do the feathers of other species, contradicting previous predictions.
B. Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, lending new support to a general prediction.
C. Barve discovered that songbirds have adapted to their environment by growing feathers without flat and smooth sections, complicating an earlier hypothesis.
D. The results of Barve's study suggest that the ability of birds to withstand cold temperatures is determined more strongly by feather length than feather structure, challenging an established belief.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The text describes how Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, which supports the general prediction that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature.
* **Incorrect (A):** Barve's study isn't said to contradict previous predictions. In fact, the study supports the prediction described in the first sentence, which is that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature.
* **Incorrect (C):** Barve's study isn't said to "complicate an earlier hypothesis." In fact, the study supports the earlier prediction described in the first sentence, which is that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text doesn't compare the importance of feather length and feather structure, and it doesn't say that Barve's study challenges any established beliefs. In fact, the study supports the prediction described in the first sentence, which is that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Paleontologists searching for signs of ancient life have found many fossilized specimens of prehistoric human ancestors, including several from the Pleistocene era discovered in a geological formation in the Minatogawa quarry in Japan. However, to study the emergence of the earliest multicellular organisms to appear on Earth, researchers must turn elsewhere, such as to the Ediacaran geological formation at Mistaken Point in Canada. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 146-hectare reserve contains more than 10,000 fossils that together document a critical moment in evolutionary history.

**Question:**
What does the text indicate about the geological formation at Mistaken Point?

**Options:**
A. It holds a greater number of fossils but from a smaller variety of species than the formation in the Minatogawa quarry does.
B. It has provided evidence that the earliest human species may have emerged before the Pleistocene era.
C. It is widely considered by paleontologists to be the most valuable source of information about prehistoric life forms.
D. It contains specimens from an older time period than those found in the formation in the Minatogawa quarry.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The text says that the formation at Mistaken Point contains fossils of "the earliest multicellular organisms," which implies that these fossils are from an older time period than the fossils of "prehistoric human ancestors" found in the Minatogawa quarry.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text says that the formation at Mistake Point contains "more than 10,000 fossils," but it doesn't compare this number to the number of fossils in the Minatogawa quarry. It also doesn't say anything about the variety of species in either formation.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text says that the formation at Mistaken Point contains fossils of "the earliest multicellular organisms," but it never says that the site contains early human fossils too. Rather, the early human fossils mentioned in the text were found in the formation at Minatogawa quarry.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text says that the fossils at Mistaken Point "document a critical moment in evolutionary history," but it never says that Mistaken Point is the most valuable source of information about prehistoric life forms.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Edgar Allan Poe's 1849 story "Landor's Cottage." During a pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of B-, where I had determined to stop for the night.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

**Options:**
A. The narrator remembers a trip he took and admits to getting lost.
B. The narrator recalls fond memories of a journey that he took through some beautiful river counties.
C. The narrator describes what he saw during a long trip through a frequently visited location.
D. The narrator explains the difficulties he encountered on a trip and how he overcame them.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The narrator is "embarrassed" about the route he took, which ends up leaving him lost and confused about how to get to his destination for the evening.
* **Incorrect (B):** This choice doesn't match the passage. The narrator is embarrassed, rather than fond, and he doesn't describe the beauty of the place.
* **Incorrect (C):** We don't know from this excerpt whether or not the narrator has visited this part of New York multiple times.
* **Incorrect (D):** The narrator doesn't explain how he overcame being lost in this excerpt.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Philadelphia's Black Pearl Chamber Orchestra, founded by Jeri Lynne Johnson, performs classical music, from well-known compositions by Beethoven to contemporary works by Jessie Montgomery. For the orchestra's iConduct! program, Johnson invites community members to learn some basic elements of conducting and then experience conducting the Black Pearl orchestra themselves.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

**Options:**
A. The Black Pearl orchestra performs music from all over the world but mostly performs music composed by Philadelphians.
B. Johnson founded the Black Pearl orchestra to perform classical music by contemporary artist Jessie Montgomery.
C. The Black Pearl orchestra gives community members the chance to both listen to and participate in classical music performance.
D. Johnson has community members conduct an orchestra to demonstrate how difficult the task is.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The text states that the Black Pearl orchestra performs classical music and then explains that the orchestra's iConduct! program offers community members the opportunity to learn about and apply conducting techniques by leading the orchestra themselves. Therefore, the main idea is that the orchestra allows community members to both listen to and participate in classical music performance.
* **Incorrect (A):** While the text mentions the orchestra is in Philadelphia, it does not state that most of the music it plays was composed by Philadelphians.
* **Incorrect (B):** The founding of the orchestra is a detail, not the main focus, and the text does not state that it was founded solely for the purpose of performing Montgomery's work.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not indicate that Johnson's purpose for the iConduct! program is to show how difficult the task is.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
To dye wool, Navajo (Diné) weaver Lillie Taylor uses plants and vegetables from Arizona, where she lives. For example, she achieved the deep reds and browns featured in her 2003 rug In the Path of the Four Seasons by using Arizona dock roots, drying and grinding them before mixing the powder with water to create a dye bath. To intensify the appearance of certain colors, Taylor also sometimes mixes in clay obtained from nearby soil.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

**Options:**
A. Reds and browns are not commonly featured in most of Taylor's rugs.
B. Taylor draws on local resources in the approach she uses to dye wool.
C. Taylor finds it difficult to locate Arizona dock root in the desert.
D. In the Path of the Four Seasons is widely acclaimed for its many colors and innovative weaving techniques.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The text opens with the statement that Taylor uses local plants and vegetables to dye wool, and the rest of the text provides an example of how she does this, making this the main idea.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text only mentions one rug, and it doesn't indicate whether the colors in it are common in her other work.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text never says that Taylor finds it difficult to locate Arizona dock roots.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text never states that the rug is widely acclaimed. It only uses the rug as an example to support the main idea.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The painter María Izquierdo played an important role in the development of twentieth-century Mexican art, but her work has never been well-known in the United States except among art historians. One reason for Izquierdo's relative obscurity is the enormous popularity of some of her peers. In particular, the painters Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera have so captivated the interest of US audiences that Izquierdo and other Mexican artists from the period often get overlooked, despite the high quality of their work.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

**Options:**
A. Izquierdo's work is not as well-known in the United States as it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw so much of the public's attention.
B. During Izquierdo's lifetime, her paintings were displayed in galleries in the United States much more frequently than paintings by Kahlo and Rivera were.
C. Izquierdo painted some of the same subjects that Kahlo and Rivera painted but used different techniques than they used.
D. Few of Izquierdo's works are in galleries today because she produced only a small number of paintings.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The text states that María Izquierdo was an important figure in Mexican art but her work is not well-known in the US because her peers, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, are so popular that they overshadow other artists, including Izquierdo.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text does not discuss the frequency of Izquierdo's paintings in galleries during her lifetime.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text does not discuss the subject matter or techniques of Izquierdo's paintings, nor does it compare them to Kahlo's and Rivera's.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not mention how many of Izquierdo's paintings are in galleries today, or if she produced only a small number of paintings.
