**Passage:**
Text 1
In 1916, H. Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that The Two Noble Kinsmen was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher's contributions to the play were obvious-Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sufficient evidence of Fletcher's authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger.

Text 2
Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare's complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the first act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, both Sykes in Text 1 and the scholars in Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?

**Options:**
A. John Fletcher's writing has a unique, readily identifiable style.
B. The women characters in John Fletcher's plays are similar to the women characters in Philip Massinger's plays.
C. The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in one-volume compilations of Shakespeare's complete plays.
D. Philip Massinger's style in the first and last acts of The Two Noble Kinsmen is an homage to Shakespeare's style.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** Both texts imply that Fletcher's writing has a unique, readily identifiable style that can be used to distinguish his work from others. Text 1 states that Sykes felt Fletcher's contributions to the play were obvious because he had a distinct style. Text 2 states that scholars generally agree "on the basis of style" that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts.
* **Incorrect (B):** Neither text compares the women characters in Fletcher's plays to the women characters in Massinger's plays.
* **Incorrect (C):** Sykes would disagree that the play belongs in a Shakespeare compilation because he disputed that Shakespeare coauthored it.
* **Incorrect (D):** Neither text suggests that Massinger was inspired by Shakespeare or mentions Massinger in Text 2.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Growth in the use of novel nanohybrids-materials created from the conjugation of multiple distinct nanomaterials, such as iron oxide and gold nanomaterials conjugated for use in magnetic imaging-has outpaced studies of nanohybrids' environmental risks. Unfortunately, risk evaluations based on nanohybrids' constituents are not reliable: conjugation may alter constituents' physiochemical properties such that innocuous nanomaterials form a nanohybrid that is anything but.

Text 2
The potential for enhanced toxicity of nanohybrids relative to the toxicity of constituent nanomaterials has drawn deserved attention, but the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case. For instance, it was recently shown that a nanohybrid of silicon dioxide and zinc oxide preserved the desired optical transparency of zinc oxide nanoparticles while mitigating the nanoparticles' potential to damage DNA.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assertion in the underlined portion of Text 1?

**Options:**
A. By concurring that the risk described in Text 1 should be evaluated but emphasizing that the risk is more than offset by the potential benefits of nanomaterial conjugation
B. By arguing that the situation described in Text 1 may not be representative but conceding that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation are harder to predict than researchers had expected
C. By denying that the circumstance described in Text 1 is likely to occur but acknowledging that many aspects of nanomaterial conjugation are still poorly understood
D. By agreeing that the possibility described in Text 1 is a cause for concern but pointing out that nanomaterial conjugation does not inevitably produce that result

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The author of Text 2 would agree that the possibility of enhanced toxicity is a cause for concern, as they state that this potential "has drawn deserved attention". However, they would also point out that nanomaterial conjugation does not inevitably produce this result, citing an example where a nanohybrid actually mitigated the potential for harm.
* **Incorrect (A):** The author of Text 2 does not argue that the benefits outweigh the risks; they simply state that the effects "vary by case".
* **Incorrect (B):** The author of Text 2 acknowledges the "deserved attention" that the potential toxicity of nanohybrids has drawn, which suggests they would not argue that the situation in Text 1 is unrepresentative.
* **Incorrect (C):** The author of Text 2 agrees that the potential for toxicity is a cause for concern, so they would not deny that the circumstance is likely to occur.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Africa's Sahara region-once a lush ecosystem-began to dry out about 8,000 years ago. A change in Earth's orbit that affected climate has been posited as a cause of desertification, but archaeologist David Wright also attributes the shift to Neolithic peoples. He cites their adoption of pastoralism as a factor in the region drying out: the pastoralists' livestock depleted vegetation, prompting the events that created the Sahara Desert.

Text 2
Research by Chris Brierley et al. challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed to the Sahara's desertification. Using a climate-vegetation model, the team concluded that the end of the region's humid period occurred 500 years earlier than previously assumed. The timing suggests that Neolithic peoples didn't exacerbate aridity in the region but, in fact, may have helped delay environmental changes with practices (e.g., selective grazing) that preserved vegetation.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, how would Chris Brierley (Text 2) most likely respond to the discussion in Text 1?

**Options:**
A. By pointing out that given the revised timeline for the end of the Sahara's humid period, the Neolithic peoples' mode of subsistence likely didn't cause the region's desertification
B. By claiming that pastoralism was only one of many behaviors the Neolithic peoples took part in that may have contributed to the Sahara's changing climate
C. By insisting that pastoralism can have both beneficial and deleterious effects on a region's vegetation and climate
D. By asserting that more research needs to be conducted into factors that likely contributed to the desertification of the Sahara region

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** Brierley's research directly challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed to the Sahara's desertification by showing that the humid period ended 500 years earlier than previously thought. This revised timeline would lead Brierley to conclude that pastoralism likely did not cause the region to dry out, and may have even helped to preserve vegetation.
* **Incorrect (B):** Brierley's research disputes the idea that any Neolithic peoples' behaviors contributed to the changing climate.
* **Incorrect (C):** Brierley's research only describes a beneficial effect of pastoralism, not both beneficial and negative effects.
* **Incorrect (D):** Brierley's research does not call for more research; it presents a conclusion based on new findings.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Soy sauce, made from fermented soybeans, is noted for its umami flavor. Umami-one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, salty, and sour-was formally classified when its taste receptors were discovered in the 2000s. In 2007, to define the pure umami flavor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O'Mahony used broths made from shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed, and two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agreed on a description of the taste.

Text 2
A 2022 experiment by Manon Jünger et al. led to a greater understanding of soy sauce's flavor profile. The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce. Further analysis of soy sauce identified proteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami flavor and also contributed to saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that re-created soy sauce's flavor.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, if Ishii and O'Mahony (Text 1) and Jünger et al. (Text 2) were aware of the findings of both experiments, they would most likely agree with which statement?

**Options:**
A. On average, the diets of people in the United States tend to have fewer foods that contain certain dipeptides than the diets of people in Japan have.
B. Chemical compounds that activate both the umami and salty taste receptors tend to have a higher molecular weight than those that only activate umami taste receptors.
C. Fermentation introduces proteins responsible for the increase of umami flavor in soy sauce, and those proteins also increase the perception of saltiness.
D. The broths in the 2007 experiment most likely did not have a substantial amount of the dipeptides that played a key part in the 2022 experiment.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** Ishii and O'Mahony's experiment sought to define the pure umami flavor using broths from mushrooms and seaweed. Jünger et al.'s experiment found that dipeptides, a type of protein, enhanced umami flavor and contributed to saltiness in soy sauce. Since the broths used by Ishii and O'Mahony did not contain soy sauce, it is highly likely that they would agree that their broths did not have a substantial amount of the dipeptides that were key to recreating soy sauce's flavor in the later experiment.
* **Incorrect (A):** Neither text provides information about the diets of people in the United States or Japan.
* **Incorrect (B):** While Text 2 mentions molecular weights, there is not enough information in Text 1 to draw a conclusion about what the scientists in Text 1 would say about molecular weight.
* **Incorrect (C):** Neither text states that fermentation introduces the proteins that enhance umami flavor and saltiness.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
In 2021, a team led by Amir Siraj hypothesized that the Chicxulub impactor-the object that struck the Yucatán Peninsula sixty-six million years ago, precipitating the mass extinction of the dinosaurs-was likely a member of the class of long-period comets. As evidence, Siraj cited the carbonaceous chondritic composition of samples from the Chicxulub impact crater as well as of samples obtained from long-period comet Wild 2 in 2006.

Text 2
Although long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, asteroids are similarly rich in these materials. Furthermore, some asteroids are rich in iridium, as Natalia Artemieva points out, whereas long-period comets are not. Given the prevalence of iridium at the crater and, more broadly, in geological layers deposited worldwide following the impact, Artemieva argues that an asteroid is a more plausible candidate for the Chicxulub impactor.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, how would Artemieva (Text 2) most likely respond to Siraj's hypothesis?

**Options:**
A. By granting that Siraj's hypothesis is plausible but noting that it is not supported by the available evidence.
B. By pointing out that Siraj's hypothesis is founded on a false premise about the composition of long-period comets.
C. By conceding that Siraj has identified a key similarity between long-period comets and the Chicxulub impactor but raising a countervailing point.
D. By claiming that Siraj's hypothesis is based on a narrow set of facts and does not account for the full range of evidence.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** Artemieva would concede that Siraj has identified a similarity-the presence of carbonaceous chondrites-between long-period comets and the Chicxulub impactor. However, she would raise a countervailing point that asteroids also have carbonaceous chondrites and, unlike comets, they are rich in iridium, which is prevalent at the impact site.
* **Incorrect (A):** Artemieva does not claim that Siraj's hypothesis is unsupported; she provides an alternative explanation that she considers more plausible.
* **Incorrect (B):** Artemieva acknowledges that long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, which is the basis of Siraj's claim, so she would not say the premise is false.
* **Incorrect (D):** Artemieva does not claim that Siraj's hypothesis is based on a narrow set of facts; she introduces a new piece of evidence (iridium) to support a different conclusion.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
The golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis) produces an extremely potent venom that it stores in glands beneath its skin. The frog's venom is thought to function as a defense mechanism against predators. Yet despite the high toxicity of the venom, the golden poison frog is not immune to its effects. In fact, a dose of its own venom can be fatal to a frog if the venom enters its bloodstream.

Text 2
In the wild, the golden poison frog consumes beetles that carry the same toxins as the frog's venom. The frog does not produce its own venom; instead, it extracts and stores the beetles' toxins in its skin. Scientists have studied the frogs to better understand why their own venom is not toxic to them. Researchers believe that a genetic mutation, which allows the frog's own sodium channels to bind to a different toxin than the one in its venom, has made the frog immune to the toxic effects of its own venom.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 2 most likely say about the claim made in the underlined sentence of Text 1?

**Options:**
A. The claim is incorrect because the golden poison frog's venom is an extremely potent venom that the frog has an immunity to.
B. The claim is correct because the golden poison frog's immunity to the venom is not 100 percent effective.
C. The claim is incorrect because the frog produces its own venom and cannot be harmed by it.
D. The claim is correct, but it is not because the venom enters its bloodstream.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The underlined sentence in Text 1 claims that the frog is not immune to its own venom. However, Text 2 directly contradicts this by stating that a genetic mutation has made the frog "immune to the toxic effects of its own venom".
* **Incorrect (B):** This would support Text 1's claim, which the author of Text 2 would disagree with.
* **Incorrect (C):** The author of Text 2 states that the frog does not produce its own venom, making this statement factually incorrect.
* **Incorrect (D):** This would agree with the claim in Text 1, which the author of Text 2 would disagree with.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
The planet Mars is known for its distinctive red color. Although it has long been assumed that the red dust on Mars comes from rust on the surface, some scientists now believe that the red color is caused by a different process. In a 2023 study, a team of scientists led by Dr. Peter H. Smith suggested that the dust is not a result of rust, but rather a result of constant bombardment by micrometeorites.

Text 2
In 2011, a team of scientists led by Dr. Albert Yen studied data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which showed a rapid change in the color of the Martian soil. The team concluded that the change was the result of a process called "rusting," in which iron-rich rocks on the planet's surface were exposed to oxygen and water. Dr. Yen's findings, which are consistent with other studies, have been used to explain the red color of Mars.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, how would Dr. Smith (Text 1) most likely respond to the study discussed in Text 2?

**Options:**
A. Dr. Yen's study is not a reliable source of information about the composition of the Martian surface.
B. Dr. Yen's study does not account for the fact that the red color of Mars is a result of micrometeorite bombardment, not rust.
C. Dr. Yen's study is too old to be a reliable indicator of recent changes in the Martian soil.
D. Dr. Yen's study's conclusions are plausible, but the process of rust on Mars is not the only explanation for the planet's red color.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** Dr. Smith and his team suggested that the red color of Mars is "not a result of rust" but a result of "constant bombardment by micrometeorites". Dr. Smith would therefore likely respond to Dr. Yen's study by pointing out that it is based on the assumption that rust is the cause of the red color, which his own research contradicts.
* **Incorrect (A):** Dr. Smith's claim is an alternative hypothesis, not a refutation of the reliability of Yen's data collection methods.
* **Incorrect (C):** Dr. Smith's claim is based on a different theory of how Mars got its red color, not on the timeliness of Dr. Yen's study.
* **Incorrect (D):** The author of Text 1 states that the dust is "not a result of rust," which suggests they would not find the conclusions of a study based on rust to be plausible.
