export const content = `### Question 1 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Public policy researcher Anthony Fowler studied the history of elections in Australia, a country that requires citizens to vote. Fowler argues that requiring citizens to vote leads to a significant increase in voters who would otherwise not have the time or motivation to vote. Thus, election results in countries that require citizens to vote better reflect the preferences of the country as a whole.

Text 2
Governments in democratic countries function better when more people vote. However, forcing people to vote may have negative consequences. Shane P. Singh and Jason Roy studied what happens when a country requires its citizens to vote. They found that when people feel forced to vote, they tend to spend less time looking for information about their choices when voting. As a result, votes from these voters may not reflect their actual preferences.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, how would Singh and Roy (Text 2) most likely respond to the research discussed in Text 1?

**Options:**
A. Only countries of a certain population size should implement mandatory voting.
B. People who are forced to vote are likely to become politically engaged in other ways, such as volunteering or running for office.
C. Requiring people to vote does not necessarily lead to election outcomes that better represent the preferences of the country as a whole.
D. Countries that require voting must also make the process of voting easier for their citizens.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** Text 1 claims that mandatory voting results in elections that "better reflect the preferences of the country". Singh and Roy disagree, claiming that more voters doesn't equal more quality votes; instead, they argue that forced voting may lead to less-informed votes that "may not reflect [voters'] actual preferences".
* **Incorrect (A):** Neither text mentions the population size of countries that require voting, or how that might affect election outcomes.
* **Incorrect (B):** Neither text discusses the effects of mandatory voting on other forms of political engagement.
* **Incorrect (D):** Neither text discusses the ease or difficulty of the voting process in countries that require voting.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Dance choreographer Alvin Ailey's deep admiration for jazz music can most clearly be felt in the rhythms and beats his works were set to. Ailey collaborated with some of the greatest jazz legends, like Charles Mingus, Charlie Parker, and perhaps his favorite, Duke Ellington. With his choice of music, Ailey helped bring jazz to life for his audiences.

Text 2
Jazz is present throughout Ailey's work, but it's most visible in Ailey's approach to choreography. Ailey often incorporated improvisation, a signature characteristic of jazz music, in his work. When managing his dance company, Ailey rarely forced his dancers to an exact set of specific moves. Instead, he encouraged his dancers to let their own skills and experiences shape their performances, as jazz musicians do.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?

**Options:**
A. Dancers who worked with Ailey greatly appreciated his supportive approach as a choreographer.
B. Ailey's work was strongly influenced by jazz.
C. Audiences were mostly unfamiliar with the jazz music in Ailey's works.
D. Ailey blended multiple genres of music together when choreographing dance pieces.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** Author 1 states that Ailey had a "deep admiration for jazz music" and that he "helped bring jazz to life for his audiences". Author 2 states that "Jazz is present throughout Ailey's work". While the authors name different aspects of Ailey's work as the most influenced by jazz, they agree that jazz was a strong influence.
* **Incorrect (A):** This isn't something that either text claims. Neither text mentions how Ailey's dancers felt about his approach as a choreographer, so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this.
* **Incorrect (C):** This isn't something that either text claims. Neither text mentions how familiar audiences were with any aspect of Ailey's works, so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this.
* **Incorrect (D):** This isn't something that either text claims. Neither text mentions any genre of music other than jazz, so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Historians studying pre-Inca Peru have looked to ceramic vessels to understand daily life among the Moche people. These mold-made sculptures present plants, animals, and human faces in precise ways-vessels representing human faces are so detailed that scholars have interpreted facial markings to represent scars and other skin irregularities. Some historians have even used these objects to identify potential skin diseases that may have afflicted people at the time.

Text 2
Art historian and archaeologist Lisa Trever has argued that the interpretation of Moche "portrait" vessels as hyper-realistic portrayals of identifiable people may inadvertently disregard the creativity of the objects' creators. Moche ceramic vessels, Trever argues, are artworks in which sculptors could free their imagination, using realistic objects and people around them as inspiration to explore more abstract concepts.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, what would Lisa Trever (Text 2) most likely say about the interpretation presented in the underlined portion of Text 1?

**Options:**
A. Depictions of human faces are significantly more realistic than depictions of plants and other animals are.
B. It is likely that some depictions of human faces with extensive markings are intended to portray the same historical individual.
C. Some vessels may have been damaged during their excavation and thus provide little insight into Moche culture.
D. Markings on depictions of human faces are not necessarily intended to portray particular details about the physical appearance of individuals.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** Trever thinks that the "hyper-realistic portrayal of identifiable people" interpretation ignores the sculptors' imagination and creativity. We can infer that Trever thinks the facial markings on the sculptures may not have represented real skin blemishes on real people.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text compares the depictions of human faces to the depictions of plants or animals, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. There's nothing in either text about multiple depictions representing the same person, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text mentions the state of the vessels (damaged or intact), so we have no basis to draw this conclusion.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Italian painters in the 1500s rarely depicted themselves in their work. Even more rare were self-portrait paintings that portrayed the artist as a painter. At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. In the city of Bologna, the first artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci. A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette.

Text 2
In their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana's 1577 painting, Self-Portrait at the Keyboard, stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna. Although the artist is depicted playing music, in the background, one can spot a painting easel by a window.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?

**Options:**
A. Carracci and Fontana were among the most well-respected painters in Bologna at the time.
B. The depiction of Fontana in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was intended to underscore the artist's creativity.
C. Fontana likely inspired the reference to an easel and palette in Carracci's painting.
D. Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was painted earlier than Carracci's painting and also refers to the artist's craft.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** The author of Text 2 states that Fontana's painting, which depicts a painting easel in the background, was made in 1577, eight years before Carracci's painting. Therefore, they might argue that Carracci was not "the first artist" to depict themself as a painter.
* **Incorrect (A):** The texts don't support this choice. Neither text mentions the reputation or status of either Carracci or Fontana.
* **Incorrect (B):** The author of Text 2 does not comment on the intention or meaning of Fontana's self-depiction in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard.
* **Incorrect (C):** The author of Text 2 does not suggest any inspirational relationship between Fontana and Carracci. The author of Text 2 is concerned with showing that Fontana's painting is the earliest example of an artist referring to painting in their self-portrait, but makes no mention of her influence on others.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Today the starchy root cassava is found in many dishes across West Africa, but its rise to popularity was slow. Portuguese traders brought cassava from Brazil to the West African coast in the 1500s. But at this time, people living in the capitals further inland had little contact with coastal communities. Thus, cassava remained relatively unknown to most of the region's inhabitants until the 1800s.

Text 2
Cassava's slow adoption into the diet of West Africans is mainly due to the nature of the crop itself. If not cooked properly, cassava can be toxic. Knowledge of how to properly prepare cassava needed to spread before the food could grow in popularity. The arrival of formerly enslaved people from Brazil in the 1800s, who brought their knowledge of cassava and its preparation with them, thus directly fueled the spread of this crop.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?

**Options:**
A. Cassava did not become a significant crop in West Africa until long after it was first introduced.
B. Several of the most commonly grown crops in West Africa are originally from Brazil.
C. The climate of the West African coast in the 1500s prevented cassava's spread in the region.
D. The most commonly used methods to cook cassava today date to the 1500s.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** Text 1 states that cassava's "rise to popularity was slow" in West Africa. Text 2 also describes cassava's "slow adoption into the diet of West Africans". While the two texts identify different causes for this slow adoption, both agree that cassava took a long time to catch on.
* **Incorrect (B):** This isn't something that either text claims. Cassava is the only crop discussed in the passages, so we have no basis to draw conclusions about what the authors might say about "several" crops.
* **Incorrect (C):** This isn't something that either text claims. Neither text mentions the "climate of the West African coast," so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this.
* **Incorrect (D):** This isn't something that either text claims. The 1500s were when cassava was brought to West Africa, but neither text describes how cassava is cooked, nor do they make any claims about when cooking methods were developed.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
On April 26th, 1777, Sybil Ludington rode 40 miles by horse through Putnam County, New York, to gather up local militia. British forces were burning nearby Danbury, Connecticut, and Ludington wanted to rally rebel troops to meet them. Although she was only 16 years old at the time, her brave feat made Ludington one of the heroes of the American Revolution. Since then, Ludington has been widely celebrated, inspiring postage stamps, statues, and even children's TV series.

Text 2
Many historians question the historical accuracy of the tale of Sybil Ludington. Ludington's ride was first recounted in a 1907 book, 130 years after it supposedly occurred. The author of the book, who was Ludington's great-grandnephew, may have used the story to make a case for a new road in Putnam County. There is no evidence in any of the letters, diaries, or records from the time that Ludington's ride ever took place.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 2 most likely say about the claim made in the underlined portion of Text 1?

**Options:**
A. Ludington's brave feat may not have taken place at all.
B. There may be other events from the American Revolution that are more worthy of celebration.
C. Ludington was celebrated more for her youth than for her heroism.
D. Ludington's ride was not as long as her great-grandnephew claimed it was.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The underlined portion of Text 1 describes Ludington's ride as a "brave feat." The author of Text 2 questions the historical accuracy of the tale and states that there is no evidence that her ride ever took place.
* **Incorrect (B):** The author of Text 2 doesn't make any claims about other events from the American Revolution.
* **Incorrect (C):** The author of Text 2 doesn't make any claims about why Ludington was celebrated.
* **Incorrect (D):** The author of Text 2 doesn't discuss the length of the ride but rather questions its existence.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
The ocean is an essential part of Earth's climate system, absorbing huge amounts of heat and carbon from the atmosphere. A study of ocean fossils led by oceanographer Yair Rosenthal found that over 130,000 years, from the end of one ice age to the beginning of the next, the deepest parts of the Pacific Ocean warmed by 2 degrees Celsius. Rosenthal and his team concluded that the ocean's massive volume allowed it to absorb more than a quarter of the total heat from the last glacial-interglacial transition.

Text 2
Climate scientists have been studying the absorption of heat by the ocean for a number of years. Climate models have consistently shown that the deep ocean has the capacity to absorb most of the excess atmospheric heat, and a 2010 study of ocean temperatures found that the deep ocean warmed by 0.08 degrees Celsius from 1990 to 2005.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the study discussed in Text 1?

**Options:**
A. The study's focus on the Pacific Ocean may mean the study's conclusions are not broadly applicable.
B. The study's conclusions about the ocean's heat absorption are consistent with other findings in the field.
C. The study's method of using ocean fossils is less reliable than the methods used in other studies.
D. The study's timeline is too long to be a reliable indicator of recent changes in ocean temperatures.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The author of Text 2 would agree with Rosenthal's conclusion that the ocean has absorbed a significant amount of heat. Both texts claim that the ocean has the capacity to absorb atmospheric heat. Text 1 supports this with a finding of 2 degrees Celsius of warming in the deep Pacific Ocean over 130,000 years. Text 2 cites models and other studies that show the deep ocean has the capacity to absorb most excess heat.
* **Incorrect (A):** The author of Text 2 makes no claim about the applicability of Rosenthal's study.
* **Incorrect (C):** The author of Text 2 makes no claim about the reliability of different methods of oceanography.
* **Incorrect (D):** The author of Text 2 makes no claim about the reliability of different timelines for studying ocean temperatures.
