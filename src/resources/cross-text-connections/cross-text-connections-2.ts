**Passage:**
Text 1
Microbes are tiny organisms in the soil, water, and air all around us. They thrive even in very harsh conditions. That's why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn't seem to contain any life. The finding doesn't prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes' survival.

Text 2
Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it's unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer's team's study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn't detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, Fierer's team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?

**Options:**
A. Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures.
B. A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site.
C. Microbes are likely difficult to detect in the soil at the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere.
D. Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** Fierer's team (Text 1) states that their finding suggests the environment "severely restricts microbes' survival". The author of Text 2 agrees that the presence of "so few" organisms would "show how challenging the conditions are". Both texts, therefore, agree that most microbes would be unable to withstand the conditions at the site.
* **Incorrect (A):** Neither text compares how microbes survive in dry versus cold conditions.
* **Incorrect (B):** Text 1 does not indicate that another sample would have different results. While the author of Text 2 suggests microbes may be hard to detect, they do not imply that a new sample would contain a much higher number of them.
* **Incorrect (C):** The author of Text 2 speculates that the microbes were too few to be detected, not that they were smaller than typical microbes. Text 1 does not speculate about the size of the microbes.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
The idea that time moves in only one direction is instinctively understood, yet it puzzles physicists. According to the second law of thermodynamics, at a macroscopic level some processes of heat transfer are irreversible due to the production of entropy-after a transfer we cannot rewind time and place molecules back exactly where they were before, just as we cannot unbreak dropped eggs. But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible.

Text 2
In 2015, physicists Tiago Batalhão et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform. But the experiment "does not pinpoint... what causes [irreversibility] at the microscopic level," coauthor Mauro Paternostro said.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 1 most likely say about the experiment described in Text 2?

**Options:**
A. It would suggest an interesting direction for future research were it not the case that two of the physicists who conducted the experiment disagree on the significance of its findings.
B. It provides empirical evidence that the current understanding of an aspect of physics at a microscopic level must be incomplete.
C. It is consistent with the current understanding of physics at a microscopic level but not at a macroscopic level.
D. It supports a claim about an isolated system of atoms in a laboratory, but that claim should not be extrapolated to a general claim about the universe.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The author of Text 1 states that at the microscopic level, the laws of physics suggest that processes should be reversible. The experiment described in Text 2 confirms the irreversibility of these processes at a quantum level, contradicting the laws of physics at that level. The author of Text 1 would therefore likely conclude that the experiment provides evidence that the understanding of microscopic physics is incomplete.
* **Incorrect (A):** Text 2 mentions two physicists but does not state that they disagree.
* **Incorrect (C):** The experiment confirmed that the macroscopic law of irreversibility also applies at a microscopic level.
* **Incorrect (D):** Neither text distinguishes between laboratory findings and the general workings of the universe.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
The live music festival business is growing in event size and genre variety. With so many consumer options, organizers are finding ways to cement festival attendance as a special experience worth sharing. This phenomenon is linked to the growing "experiential economy," where many find it gratifying to purchase lived experiences. To ensure a profitable event, venues need to consider the overall consumer experience, not just the band lineup.

Text 2
Music festival appearances are becoming a more important part of musicians' careers. One factor in this shift is the rising use of streaming services that allow access to huge numbers of songs for a monthly fee, subsequently reducing sales of full-length albums. With this shift in consumer behavior, musicians are increasingly dependent on revenue from live performances.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?

**Options:**
A. Consumers are more interested in paying subscription fees to stream music than in attending music festivals in person.
B. Consumers' growing interest in purchasing experiences is mostly confined to the music industry.
C. Changing consumer behaviors are leading to changes in music-related businesses.
D. The rising consumer demand for live music festivals also generates higher demand for music streaming platforms.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** Both texts discuss how a change in consumer behavior is impacting the music industry. Text 1 mentions the "experiential economy" and how it influences how organizers run festivals. Text 2 discusses how the rise of streaming services has made musicians more dependent on live performances for revenue.
* **Incorrect (A):** Neither text states that consumers prefer streaming to live festivals.
* **Incorrect (B):** Text 1 describes the "experiential economy" as a broad trend, not one confined to the music industry.
* **Incorrect (D):** Neither text links the demand for festivals to the demand for streaming platforms.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
Stage lighting theorist Adolphe Appia was perhaps the first to argue that light must be considered alongside all the various elements of a stage to create a single, unified performance. Researcher Kelly Bremner, however, has noted that Appia lacked technical expertise in the use of light in the theater. As a result of Appia's inexperience, Bremner argues, Appia's theory of light called for lighting practices that weren't possible until after the advent of electricity around 1881.

Text 2
Adolphe Appia was not an amateur in the practice of lighting. Instead, it is precisely his exposure to lighting techniques at the time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light. When working as an apprentice for a lighting specialist in his youth, Appia observed the use of portable lighting devices that could be operated by hand. This experience developed his understanding of what was possible in the coordination of elements on the stage.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim about Appia's level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1?

**Options:**
A. Many lighting technicians dismissed Appia's ideas about light on the stage.
B. Appia likely gained a level of technical expertise during his time as an apprentice.
C. Theater practitioners who worked with Appia greatly admired his work.
D. Appia was unfamiliar with the use of music and sound in theater.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** The author of Text 2 directly contradicts Bremner's claim that Appia "lacked technical expertise". The author of Text 2 states that Appia was "not an amateur" and that his apprenticeship with a lighting specialist "developed his understanding of what was possible".
* **Incorrect (A):** Neither text mentions the opinions of other lighting technicians.
* **Incorrect (C):** Neither text mentions the opinions of theater practitioners who worked with Appia.
* **Incorrect (D):** The texts focus on Appia's expertise in lighting, not his familiarity with music and sound.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
In 2021, a team led by Amir Siraj hypothesized that the Chicxulub impactor-the object that struck the Yucatán Peninsula sixty-six million years ago, precipitating the mass extinction of the dinosaurs-was likely a member of the class of long-period comets. As evidence, Siraj cited the carbonaceous chondritic composition of samples from the Chicxulub impact crater as well as of samples obtained from long-period comet Wild 2 in 2006.

Text 2
Although long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, asteroids are similarly rich in these materials. Furthermore, some asteroids are rich in iridium, as Natalia Artemieva points out, whereas long-period comets are not. Given the prevalence of iridium at the crater and, more broadly, in geological layers deposited worldwide following the impact, Artemieva argues that an asteroid is a more plausible candidate for the Chicxulub impactor.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, how would Artemieva likely respond to Siraj's hypothesis?

**Options:**
A. By granting that Siraj's hypothesis is plausible but noting that it is not supported by the available evidence.
B. By pointing out that Siraj's hypothesis is founded on a false premise about the composition of long-period comets.
C. By conceding that Siraj has identified a key similarity between long-period comets and the Chicxulub impactor but raising a countervailing point.
D. By claiming that Siraj's hypothesis is based on a narrow set of facts and does not account for the full range of evidence.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** The author of Text 2, Artemieva, concedes that long-period comets and the crater have a shared characteristic (carbonaceous chondrites) that Siraj identifies as evidence. However, Artemieva raises a "countervailing point" about the presence of iridium at the crater and in geological layers worldwide, which is a characteristic of asteroids but not long-period comets. This leads Artemieva to conclude that an asteroid is a more plausible candidate.
* **Incorrect (A):** Artemieva argues for a more plausible candidate, not that Siraj's hypothesis is not supported by any evidence.
* **Incorrect (B):** Artemieva acknowledges that long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, which is the basis of Siraj's claim. Therefore, she would not say his premise is false.
* **Incorrect (D):** Artemieva does not claim that Siraj's hypothesis is based on a narrow set of facts, but rather that there is other evidence that points to a different conclusion.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
An enduring mystery surrounding the works of William Shakespeare is the extent to which he collaborated with other writers. A number of plays, for example, show evidence of collaboration. The play Pericles, Prince of Tyre is now widely considered to be a collaboration between Shakespeare and George Wilkins, a London writer and innkeeper. However, due to limited resources from the period, it is difficult to determine precisely how extensive these collaborations were.

Text 2
The Shakespearean play The Two Noble Kinsmen, a story about two friends who fall in love with the same woman, is widely thought to have been a collaboration. There are no definitive records from the time that name the writers of the play. But linguist Donald Foster, after a close analysis of the play, concluded that it was a collaboration between Shakespeare and fellow playwright John Fletcher. Foster was able to confirm his claim by examining the text's shared vocabulary, stylistic similarities, and rhythmic patterns.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, a scholar of Shakespeare would most likely agree with which statement?

**Options:**
A. Collaboration with other writers was one of the most common practices in William Shakespeare's career.
B. Linguistic analysis can be a useful tool for identifying and understanding collaborative works by William Shakespeare.
C. The play The Two Noble Kinsmen is an example of a play written by two collaborators who were not both well-known playwrights.
D. Records from the sixteenth century offer more information on the collaborations of William Shakespeare than do records from the seventeenth century.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** Text 1 states that it is difficult to determine the extent of Shakespeare's collaborations because of "limited resources from the period". Text 2 then gives an example of how a linguist used "linguistic analysis" to identify a collaboration between Shakespeare and another playwright. Therefore, both texts imply that linguistic analysis is a useful tool for studying Shakespeare's collaborations.
* **Incorrect (A):** Text 1 states that a number of plays show evidence of collaboration, but it does not say that it was one of the most common practices.
* **Incorrect (C):** Text 2 identifies John Fletcher as a collaborator, but it does not say that he was not a well-known playwright.
* **Incorrect (D):** Neither text makes a distinction between sixteenth-century and seventeenth-century records.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Text 1
The golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis) produces an extremely potent venom that it stores in glands beneath its skin. The frog's venom is thought to function as a defense mechanism against predators. Yet despite the high toxicity of the venom, the golden poison frog is not immune to its effects. In fact, a dose of its own venom can be fatal to a frog if the venom enters its bloodstream.

Text 2
In the wild, the golden poison frog consumes beetles that carry the same toxins as the frog's venom. The frog does not produce its own venom; instead, it extracts and stores the beetles' toxins in its skin. Scientists have studied the frogs to better understand why their own venom is not toxic to them. Researchers believe that a genetic mutation, which allows the frog's own sodium channels to bind to a different toxin than the one in its venom, has made the frog immune to the toxic effects of its own venom.

**Question:**
Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 2 most likely say about the claim made in the underlined sentence of Text 1?

**Options:**
A. The claim is incorrect because the golden poison frog's venom is an extremely potent venom that the frog has an immunity to.
B. The claim is correct because the golden poison frog's immunity to the venom is not 100 percent effective.
C. The claim is incorrect because the frog produces its own venom and cannot be harmed by it.
D. The claim is correct, but it is not because the venom enters its bloodstream.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** The underlined sentence in Text 1 states that the frog is "not immune to its effects" and can be killed by its own venom. However, Text 2 directly contradicts this, stating that the frog has a genetic mutation that makes it "immune to the toxic effects of its own venom".
* **Incorrect (B):** This would support Text 1's claim, but the author of Text 2 would disagree.
* **Incorrect (C):** The author of Text 2 states that the frog does not produce its own venom. This makes the claim that it produces its own venom incorrect.
* **Incorrect (D):** This choice acknowledges that the claim is correct, which the author of Text 2 would not agree with.
