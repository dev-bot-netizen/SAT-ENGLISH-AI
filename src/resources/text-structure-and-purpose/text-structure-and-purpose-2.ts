export const content = `### Question 1 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Archeological excavation of Market Street Chinatown, a nineteenth-century Chinese American community in San Jose, California, provided the first evidence that Asian food products were imported to the United States in the 1800s: bones from a freshwater fish species native to Southeast Asia. <u>Jinshanzhuang-Hong Kong-based import/export firms likely coordinated the fish's transport from Chinese-operated fisheries in Vietnam and Malaysia to North American markets.</u> This route reveals the (often overlooked) multinational dimensions of the trade networks linking Chinese diaspora communities.

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

**Options:**
A. It explains why efforts to determine the country of origin of the items mentioned in the previous sentence remain inconclusive.
B. It provides information that helps support a claim about a discovery's significance that is presented in the following sentence.
C. It traces the steps that were taken to locate and recover the objects that are described in the previous sentence.
D. It outlines a hypothesis that additional evidence discussed in the following sentence casts some doubt on.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** This is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides details about the import/export firms and trade routes, which shows how different Chinese communities were connected. This information directly supports the claim in the final sentence about the "multinational dimensions" of the trade networks.
* **Incorrect (A):** The underlined sentence does not suggest the origin is inconclusive; in fact, it specifies the countries of origin (Vietnam and Malaysia).
* **Incorrect (C):** The passage never describes the process of how the fish bones were discovered.
* **Incorrect (D):** The sentence provides evidence, not a hypothesis. Furthermore, the following sentence confirms and builds upon the information, rather than casting doubt on it.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Using NASA's powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Mercedes López-Morales and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light traveling through the atmosphere of WASP-39b, an exoplanet, or planet outside our solar system. Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of light, and the wavelength measurements showed the presence of carbon dioxide (CO_2) in WASP-39b's atmosphere. This finding not only offers the first decisive evidence of CO_2 in the atmosphere of an exoplanet but also illustrates the potential for future scientific breakthroughs held by the JWST.

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

**Options:**
A. It discusses a method used by some researchers, then states why an alternative method is superior to it.
B. It describes how researchers made a scientific discovery, then explains the importance of that discovery.
C. It outlines the steps taken in a scientific study, then presents a hypothesis based on that study.
D. It examines how a group of scientists reached a conclusion, then shows how other scientists have challenged that conclusion.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** This is the best answer. The text starts by explaining how researchers used the JWST to find CO_2 in an exoplanet's atmosphere. It then explains the significance of this discovery, both as a scientific first and as a demonstration of the JWST's capabilities.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text focuses on a single method using the JWST and does not compare it to any alternatives.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text reports the findings of a study, not a hypothesis that resulted from it.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not mention any challenges to the researchers' conclusion.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
<u>Yawn contagion occurs when one individual yawns in response to another's yawn.</u> Studies of this behavior in primates have focused on populations in captivity, but biologist Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues have shown that it can occur in wild primate populations as well. In their study, which focused on a wild population of gelada monkeys (Theropithecus gelada) in Ethiopia, the researchers further reported that yawn contagion most commonly occurred in males and across different social groups instead of within a single social group.

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the function of the first sentence in the text as a whole?

**Options:**
A. It defines a phenomenon that is discussed in the text.
B. It introduces a problem that is examined in the text.
C. It makes a claim that is challenged in the text.
D. It presents a hypothesis that is evaluated in the text.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This is the best answer because the first sentence clearly defines the term "yawn contagion." The rest of the text then discusses a study about this specific phenomenon in wild monkeys.
* **Incorrect (B):** The sentence introduces the phenomenon but does not present it as a problem.
* **Incorrect (C):** The first sentence provides a definition, not a claim, and nothing in the text challenges this definition.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not state the specific hypothesis of the study discussed; it focuses on the study's findings.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is from Joseph Conrad's 1907 novel The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Mr. Verloc is navigating the London streets on his way to a meeting.

Before reaching Knightsbridge, Mr. Verloc took a turn to the left out of the busy main thoroughfare, uproarious with the traffic of swaying omnibuses and trotting vans, in the almost silent, swift flow of hansoms [horse-drawn carriages]. Under his hat, worn with a slight backward tilt, his hair had been carefully brushed into respectful sleekness; for his business was with an Embassy. And Mr. Verloc, steady like a rock-<u>a soft kind of rock</u>-marched now along a street which could with every propriety be described as private.

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined phrase in the text as a whole?

**Options:**
A. It qualifies an earlier description of Mr. Verloc.
B. It emphasizes an internal struggle Mr. Verloc experiences.
C. It contrasts Mr. Verloc with his surroundings.
D. It reveals a private opinion Mr. Verloc holds.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This is the best answer. The underlined phrase "a soft kind of rock" qualifies, or adds a condition to, the preceding description of Mr. Verloc as "steady like a rock." It modifies the initial description to make it more complex.
* **Incorrect (B):** The passage does not mention any internal struggle experienced by Mr. Verloc.
* **Incorrect (C):** The phrase modifies the description of Mr. Verloc himself; it does not contrast him with his surroundings.
* **Incorrect (D):** The phrase is part of the narrator's description of Mr. Verloc's character; it does not reveal an opinion held by Mr. Verloc.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
In 1973, poet Miguel Algarín started inviting other writers who, like him, were Nuyorican-a term for New Yorkers of Puerto Rican heritage to gather in his apartment to present their work. The gatherings were so well attended that Algarín soon had to rent space in a cafe to accommodate them. Thus, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe was born. Moving to a permanent location in 1981, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe expanded its original scope beyond the written word, hosting art exhibitions and musical performances as well. Half a century since its inception, it continues to foster emerging Nuyorican talent.

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the overall purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. To explain what motivated Algarín to found the Nuyorican Poets Cafe
B. To situate the Nuyorican Poets Cafe within the cultural life of New York as a whole
C. To discuss why the Nuyorican Poets Cafe expanded its scope to include art and music
D. To provide an overview of the founding and mission of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** This is the best answer. The text covers the history of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, from its informal beginnings in the 1970s, to its expansion, and to its ongoing mission. This constitutes a brief overview of its founding and purpose.
* **Incorrect (A):** This is not the overall purpose. The text does not mention what specifically motivated Algarín.
* **Incorrect (B):** This is not the overall purpose. The text focuses on the Cafe itself, not the broader cultural life of New York.
* **Incorrect (C):** This is too narrow. The expansion to include art and music is just one detail in the broader history presented in the text.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Charles Dickens's 1854 novel Hard Times. Coketown is a fictional town in England.

[Coketown] contained several large streets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like one another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went in and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same pavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. To emphasize the uniformity of both the town and the people who live there
B. To explain the limited work opportunities available to the town's residents
C. To reveal how the predictability of the town makes it easy for people lose track of time
D. To argue that the simplicity of life in the town makes it a pleasant place to live

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This is the best answer. The author repeatedly uses words like "like one another" and "same" to describe the streets, people, routines, and even the passage of time in Coketown. This constant repetition serves to emphasize the extreme uniformity of the town and its inhabitants.
* **Incorrect (B):** While the text mentions everyone does "the same work," this is just one aspect of the overall uniformity and the text doesn't explain what the work is or why it's limited.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text states that time is repetitive, but it does not suggest that people actually "lose track of time." This is also too narrow to be the main purpose.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not suggest life in Coketown is pleasant; the monotonous description implies it is a dull place to live.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Paul Laurence Dunbar's 1902 novel The Sport of the Gods. Joe and some of his family members have recently moved to New York City.

[Joe] was wild with enthusiasm and with a desire to be a part of all that the metropolis meant. In the evening he saw the young fellows passing by dressed in their spruce clothes, and he wondered with a sort of envy where they could be going. Back home there had been no place much worth going to, except church and one or two people's houses.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. It illustrates a character's reaction to a new environment.
B. It explains why a character has traveled to a city.
C. It compares a character's thoughts about an event at two different times of day.
D. It presents a character feeling regret over leaving home.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This is the best answer because it accurately describes the main purpose. The text details Joe's reaction to the city, showing his enthusiasm and envy, and contrasts this new, exciting environment with his former home.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text does not provide a reason for why Joe moved to the city.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text does not compare Joe's thoughts about a single event at different times of the day. It describes his general feelings in the evening and contrasts the city with his old home.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not suggest Joe feels regret. In fact, he is "wild with enthusiasm" for his new life in the city, which is portrayed as more exciting than his old home.
