**Passage:**
The field of study called affective neuroscience seeks instinctive, physiological causes for feelings such as pleasure or displeasure. Because these sensations are linked to a chemical component (for example, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain when one receives or expects a reward), they can be said to have a partly physiological basis. These processes have been described in mammals, but Jingnan Huang and his colleagues have recently observed that some behaviors of honeybees (such as foraging) are also motivated by a dopamine-based signaling process.

**Question:**
What choice best describes the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. It describes an experimental method of measuring the strength of physiological responses in humans.
B. It illustrates processes by which certain insects can express how they are feeling.
C. It summarizes a finding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains.
D. It presents research showing that certain insects and mammals behave similarly when there is a possibility of a reward for their actions.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** This choice best describes the text's main purpose. The text first explains that feelings in mammals are linked to chemical processes like dopamine release. It then states that researchers have found a similar dopamine-related process in honeybees, suggesting a resemblance in brain mechanisms between these insects and mammals.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text does not describe any specific experimental methods. It only presents observations about mammals and honeybees.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text does not suggest that insects can express their feelings through these processes. While foraging in honeybees is linked to dopamine, this behavior is not presented as a way for them to communicate feelings.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text discusses similar internal mechanisms (dopamine-based signaling) rather than similar behaviors in response to potential rewards.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Studying late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artifacts from an agricultural and domestic site in Texas, archaeologist Ayana O. Flewellen found that Black women employed as farm workers utilized hook-and-eye closures to fasten their clothes at the waist, giving themselves a silhouette similar to the one that was popular in contemporary fashion and typically achieved through more restrictive garments such as corsets. Flewellen argues that this sartorial practice shows that these women balanced hegemonic ideals of femininity with the requirements of their physically demanding occupation.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. To describe an unexpected discovery that altered a researcher's view of how rapidly fashions among Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas changed during the period
B. To discuss research that investigated the ways in which Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas used fashion practices to resist traditional gender ideals
C. To evaluate a scholarly work that offers explanations for the impact of urban fashion ideals on Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas
D. To summarize the findings of a study that explored factors influencing a fashion practice among Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** This is the best answer. The text gives an overview of a study on the fashion practices of Black female farmworkers in a specific period in Texas, explaining how these practices were shaped by both fashion ideals and the practical needs of their work.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text doesn't mention the rate of fashion change or describe Flewellen's findings as "unexpected."
* **Incorrect (B):** The text indicates that these women were trying to achieve traditional feminine ideals with their clothing choices, not resist them.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text describes Flewellen's work rather than evaluating it. It also focuses on an "agricultural and domestic" site, not urban fashion.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Herman Melville's 1857 novel The Confidence-Man. Humphry Davy was a prominent British chemist and inventor.

Years ago, a grave American savant, being in London, observed at an evening party there, a certain coxcombical fellow, as he thought, an absurd ribbon in his lapel, and full of smart [banter], whisking about to the admiration of as many as were disposed to admire. Great was the savant's disdain; but, chancing ere long to find himself in a corner with the jackanapes, got into conversation with him, when he was somewhat ill-prepared for the good sense of the jackanapes, but was altogether thrown aback, upon subsequently being [informed that he was] no less a personage than Sir Humphry Davy.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. It portrays the thoughts of a character who is embarrassed about his own behavior.
B. It presents an account of a misunderstanding.
C. It offers a short history of how a person came to be famous.
D. It explains why one character dislikes another.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** This is the best answer. The text narrates an incident where a serious American scholar initially dismisses a guest at a party as foolish, only to be surprised to learn that this person is actually a famous and intelligent chemist. This is a classic account of a misunderstanding based on a wrong first impression.
* **Incorrect (A):** This is too narrow and strong. The savant is "thrown aback," but the text does not state he is "embarrassed about his own behavior."
* **Incorrect (C):** The text does not provide a history of how Sir Humphry Davy became famous.
* **Incorrect (D):** This is too narrow. While it explains the initial dislike, it doesn't cover the subsequent conversation and revelation, which are key to the story.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Some studies have suggested that posture can influence cognition, but we should not overstate this phenomenon. A case in point: In a 2014 study, Megan O'Brien and Alaa Ahmed had subjects stand or sit while making risky simulated economic decisions. Standing is more physically unstable and cognitively demanding than sitting; accordingly, O'Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that standing subjects would display more risk aversion during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since they would want to avoid further feelings of discomfort and complicated risk evaluations. But O'Brien and Ahmed actually found no difference in the groups' performance.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. It argues that research findings about the effects of posture on cognition are often misunderstood, as in the case of O'Brien and Ahmed's study.
B. It presents the study by O'Brien and Ahmed to critique the methods and results reported in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition.
C. It explains a significant problem in the emerging understanding of posture's effects on cognition and how O'Brien and Ahmed tried to solve that problem.
D. It discusses the study by O'Brien and Ahmed to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about the effects of posture on cognition.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** This choice best captures the main purpose. The text starts by advising caution against overstating the effects of posture on cognition. It then uses O'Brien and Ahmed's study, where posture had no effect on the subjects' decisions, as a "case in point" to illustrate why such caution is necessary.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text uses the study as an example of why we should be cautious, not as an example of misunderstood research findings. There's no suggestion that O'Brien and Ahmed's findings were misunderstood.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text does not critique the methods or results of previous studies; it merely suggests their findings shouldn't be exaggerated.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text doesn't suggest O'Brien and Ahmed were trying to solve the problem of overstating posture's effects. In fact, their hypothesis expected to find an effect of posture on cognition.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
<u>In Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park, an almost imperceptible smile from potential suitor Henry Crawford causes the protagonist Fanny Price to blush; her embarrassment grows when she suspects that he is aware of it.</u> This moment-in which Fanny not only infers Henry's mental state through his gestures, but also infers that he is drawing inferences about her mental state-illustrates what literary scholar George Butte calls "deep intersubjectivity," a technique for representing interactions between consciousnesses through which Austen's novels derive much of their social and psychological drama.

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

**Options:**
A. It states a claim about Austen's skill at representing psychological complexity that is reinforced by an example presented in the following sentence.
B. It advances an interpretation of an Austen protagonist who is contrasted with protagonists from other Austen novels cited in the following sentence.
C. It describes a recurring theme in Austen's novels that is the focus of a literary scholar's analysis summarized in the following sentence.
D. It provides a synopsis of an interaction in an Austen novel that illustrates a literary concept discussed in the following sentence.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** This is the best answer. The underlined sentence describes a specific scene from an Austen novel. This scene serves as a concrete example to help readers understand the complex literary concept of "deep intersubjectivity" that is defined and discussed in the sentence that follows.
* **Incorrect (A):** This choice inverts the structure of the text. The underlined sentence is the example, and the following sentence provides the analysis and terminology, not the other way around.
* **Incorrect (B):** No other Austen protagonists are mentioned or contrasted in the passage.
* **Incorrect (C):** The underlined sentence describes a single, specific interaction, not a "recurring theme." This interaction is used to exemplify the literary technique discussed later.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Mathematician Claude Shannon is widely regarded as a foundational figure in information theory. His most important paper, "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," published in 1948 when he was employed at Bell Labs, utilized a concept called a "binary digit" (shortened to "bit") to measure the amount of information in any signal and determine the fastest rate at which information could be transmitted while still being reliably decipherable. Robert Gallagher, one of Shannon's colleagues, said that the bit was "[Shannon's] discovery, and from it the whole communications revolution has sprung."

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

**Options:**
A. It presents a theoretical concept, illustrates how the name of the concept has changed, and shows how the name has entered common usage.
B. It introduces a respected researcher, describes an aspect of his work, and suggests why the work is historically significant.
C. It names the company where an important mathematician worked, details the mathematician's career at the company, and provides an example of the recognition he received there.
D. It mentions a paper, offers a summary of the paper's findings, and presents a researcher's commentary on the paper.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** This is the best answer. The text begins by introducing Claude Shannon, then describes his key contribution (the concept of the "bit"), and concludes with a quote from a colleague that emphasizes the historical importance of this work.
* **Incorrect (A):** This is not the overall structure. The shortening of "binary digit" to "bit" is only mentioned briefly in parentheses, and there is no discussion of the name's common usage.
* **Incorrect (C):** Shannon's employment at Bell Labs is mentioned only once and his career there is not detailed.
* **Incorrect (D):** This is too narrow. The text is about Shannon's overall importance to his field, not just this single paper.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
According to Indian economist and sociologist Radhakamal Mukerjee (1889-1968), the Eurocentric concepts that informed early twentieth-century social scientific methods-for example, the idea that all social relations are reducible to struggles between individuals-had little relevance for India. Making the social sciences more responsive to Indians' needs, Mukerjee argued, required constructing analytical categories informed by India's cultural and ecological circumstances. Mukerjee thus proposed the communalist "Indian village" as the ideal model on which to base Indian economic and social policy.

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

**Options:**
A. The text recounts Mukerjee's early training in the social scientific disciplines and then lists social policies whose implementation Mukerjee oversaw.
B. The text mentions some of Mukerjee's economic theories and then traces their impact on other Indian social scientists of the twentieth century.
C. The text presents Mukerjee's critique of the social sciences and then provides an example of his attempts to address issues he identified in his critique.
D. The text explains an influential economic theory and then demonstrates how that theory was more important to Mukerjee's work than other social scientists have acknowledged.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** This is the best answer. The text first outlines Mukerjee's critique of the social sciences as being too Eurocentric and irrelevant to India. It then gives an example of his solution to this problem: proposing a new model for social science based on the "Indian village."
* **Incorrect (A):** The text does not mention Mukerjee's training or any policies he implemented.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text does not mention the impact of Mukerjee's theories on other social scientists.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not discuss how other social scientists responded to Mukerjee's work.
