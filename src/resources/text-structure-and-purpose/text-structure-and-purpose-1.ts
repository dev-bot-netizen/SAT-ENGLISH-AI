**Passage:**
The following text is from Srimati Svarna Kumari Devi's 1894 novel The Fatal Garland (translated by A. Christina Albers in 1910). Shakti is walking near a riverbank that she visited frequently during her childhood.

She crossed the woods she knew so well. <u>The trees seemed to extend their branches like welcoming arms.</u> They greeted her as an old friend. Soon she reached the river-side.

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?

**Options:**
A. It suggests that Shakti feels uncomfortable near the river.
B. It indicates that Shakti has lost her sense of direction in the woods.
C. It emphasizes Shakti's sense of belonging in the landscape.
D. It conveys Shakti's appreciation for her long-term friendships.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (C):** This choice is the best answer because it accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions. The text establishes that Shakti knows the woods well, and the underlined portion emphasizes her familiarity and security by describing the trees as having "welcoming arms." The following sentence reinforces this by stating the trees "greeted her as an old friend." Therefore, the underlined sentence's function is to emphasize her sense of belonging.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text suggests Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, as the trees are "welcoming." Also, the underlined part describes her feelings in the woods, not by the river, which she hasn't reached yet.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text emphasizes Shakti's familiarity with the woods, not that she is lost. The welcoming trees and her feeling like an "old friend" show she is not confused.
* **Incorrect (D):** The phrase "as an old friend" is used figuratively to describe her connection to the landscape, not her friendships with people.

### Question 2 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Researchers have found a nearly 164,000-year-old molar from a member of the archaic human species known as Denisovans in a cave in Laos, suggesting that Denisovans lived in a wider range of environments than indicated by earlier evidence. <u>Before the discovery, Denisovans were thought to have lived only at high altitudes in relatively</u> cold climates in what are now Russia and China, but the discovery of the tooth in Laos suggests that they may have lived at low altitudes in relatively warm climates in Southeast Asia as well.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?

**Options:**
A. It dismisses as untrue the research presented in the previous sentence.
B. It defines a term used in the description that follows in the rest of the sentence.
C. It emphasizes the main goal of the research introduced in the previous sentence.
D. It provides context that clarifies the significance of the information that follows in the rest of the sentence.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (D):** This is the best answer. The text explains that a new discovery has expanded our understanding of Denisovans. The underlined section describes the previous understanding of where Denisovans lived, which helps the reader grasp the importance of the molar discovery: it shows they lived in more places than previously thought.
* **Incorrect (A):** The underlined part does not dismiss the new research; instead, it explains the previous beliefs about Denisovans before the new discovery was made.
* **Incorrect (B):** The underlined portion does not define any terms.
* **Incorrect (C):** The underlined portion does not state the research's main goal; the text only reports the discovery itself.

### Question 3 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Historians Tiya Miles and Roy E. Finkenbine have both documented the assistance Indigenous peoples gave to Black freedom seekers leaving the South before the US Civil War. Much of the historical evidence of this help comes from Indigenous oral traditions and from autobiographies written by the freedom seekers. <u>One such narrative is Jermain Loguen's autobiography, which tells about how Neshnabé (Potawatomi) villagers offered him food, lodging, and directions during his 1835 journey from Tennessee to Canada.</u>

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence?

**Options:**
A. It provides an example of an autobiography that describes help given by an Indigenous people to a Black freedom seeker.
B. It shows why Loguen decided to write in great detail about his experiences traveling from Tennessee to Canada in his autobiography.
C. It argues that autobiographies are particularly important sources of information about geography in the United States before the Civil War.
D. It suggests that most historians believe that Neshnabé villagers were more successful in assisting freedom seekers than other people were.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This is the best answer. The preceding sentence mentions "autobiographies written by the freedom seekers" as a source of evidence. The underlined sentence then provides a specific example of such an autobiography, which is Jermain Loguen's.
* **Incorrect (B):** The sentence does not explain Loguen's motivations for writing his autobiography.
* **Incorrect (C):** While the text identifies autobiographies as useful historical sources, it does not argue they are important for "information about geography." The underlined sentence serves as an example of a source for interactions between Indigenous people and Black freedom seekers.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not compare the Neshnabé's assistance with that of any other group.

### Question 4 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
Composer Florence Price won first place for her score Symphony in E Minor at the 1932 Wanamaker Foundation Awards. The piece was performed the following year by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a significant recognition of its quality. Price continued to compose many musical pieces throughout her career, blending traditional Black spirituals with classical European Romantic musical traditions. In recent years, Price's concertos and symphonies have been performed and recorded by several major orchestras, further preserving her work for others to enjoy.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. To provide examples of Price's importance as a composer
B. To argue that more major orchestras should perform Price's compositions
C. To describe the musical styles that inspired many of Price's symphonies
D. To compare Price's scores with those of classical European composers

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This is the best answer. The text highlights Price's importance by mentioning her award, the performance of her work by a major orchestra, her unique musical style, and recent performances and recordings.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text mentions that major orchestras have performed her work, but it does not argue that more should do so.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text briefly mentions her blending of musical styles but does so as part of a larger overview of her career, not as the main focus.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text mentions her blending of styles but does not directly compare her scores to those of European composers.

### Question 5 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Louisa May Alcott's 1869 novel An Old-Fashioned Girl. Polly, a teenager, is visiting her friend Fanny.

Fanny's friends did not interest Polly much; she was rather afraid of them [because] they seemed so much older and wiser than herself, even those younger in years. They talked about things of which she knew nothing and when Fanny tried to explain, she didn't find them interesting; indeed, some of them rather shocked and puzzled her.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. To portray Polly's reaction to Fanny's friends
B. To identify the topics Polly talks about with Fanny's friends
C. To explain how Fanny met some of her friends
D. To illustrate how Fanny's friends feel about Polly

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This is the best answer because the text focuses on showing how Polly reacted to Fanny's friends. It describes Polly as feeling afraid of them because they seemed "older and wiser" and talked about subjects that were unfamiliar and shocking to her. This clearly outlines Polly's impressions.
* **Incorrect (B):** The text does not identify any specific topics of conversation; it only states that Polly found them unfamiliar and uninteresting.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text provides no information about how Fanny met her friends.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text's focus is on Polly's feelings about the friends, not the other way around.

### Question 6 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
San Francisco is known for the colorful murals painted on many of its buildings. The densest collection of murals is found on Balmy Alley in the Mission District neighborhood. In the 1970s, Latina artists painted vivid scenes of community life on walls along this block. As the original murals have faded, later generations of artists have painted new ones over them. As a result, Balmy Alley has become a living showcase of San Francisco's artistic spirit, with its murals reflecting changes in the cultural life of the city.

**Question:**
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

**Options:**
A. To compare the Balmy Alley murals to other murals in San Francisco
B. To offer an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals
C. To urge people to protect the murals of San Francisco from decay
D. To describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco beginning in the 1970s

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (B):** This is the best answer as the text provides a concise history of the Balmy Alley murals, from their origins in the 1970s to their continuous evolution. It concludes by highlighting their significance as a reflection of the city's culture, thereby giving an overview of their history and importance.
* **Incorrect (A):** The text focuses solely on the Balmy Alley murals and does not make comparisons to murals in other parts of San Francisco.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text does not urge readers to protect the murals. Instead, it frames the process of painting over faded murals as a positive, "living showcase" of art.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text's focus is on the specific history of Balmy Alley murals, not the broader rise of mural painting across all of San Francisco.

### Question 7 of 7 ###
**Passage:**
The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde's 1897 nonfiction work De Profundis.

People whose desire is solely for self-realisation never know where they are going. They can't know. In one sense of the word it is of course necessary to know oneself: that is the first achievement of knowledge. But to recognise that the soul of a man is unknowable, is the ultimate achievement of wisdom. The final mystery is oneself. When one has weighed the sun in the balance, and measured the steps of the moon, and mapped out the seven heavens star by star, there still remains oneself. <u>Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul?</u>

**Question:**
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole?

**Options:**
A. It reinforces the text's skepticism about the possibility of truly achieving self-knowledge.
B. It speculates that some readers will share the doubts expressed in the text about the value of self-knowledge.
C. It cautions readers that the text's directions for how to achieve self-knowledge are hard to follow.
D. It concedes that the definition of self-knowledge advanced in the text is unpopular.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanations:**
* **Correct (A):** This is the best answer. The text repeatedly claims that true self-knowledge is impossible to achieve, and the final rhetorical question emphasizes this point.
* **Incorrect (B):** The question doesn't speculate about readers' doubts on the value of self-knowledge, but rather on the possibility of achieving it.
* **Incorrect (C):** The text does not provide instructions on how to achieve self-knowledge; on the contrary, it argues that it is impossible.
* **Incorrect (D):** The text does not define self-knowledge or comment on its popularity.
